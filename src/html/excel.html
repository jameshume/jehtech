		<h2>Creating Drop Down Lists and Looking Up A Matrix Using Column And Row Names</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>The Goal Of Table Lookup</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="../downloadables/LookUpAMatrix.xlsx" target="_blank">Download the Excel example here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Had wanted to index a matrix, or table, but not using the row and
				column numerical indices but using row and column labels. Lets take 
				a look at a little toy example. I have a matrix of students names and
				their score for a set of subjects in the following excel spreadhseet:
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_table_row_col_labeled.PNG" 
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet with a table with row names and column headers"/>
			<p>
				So why index the table using names? Because I want the user to
				select a row and column entry from a list and be returned the result from the
				table... I want the user to say &quot;give me Jim's score for Maths&quot; 
				and not have to know that Jim is column 1 of the table and that maths
				is row 1 of the table:
			</p>
			<h3>Creating Drop Down Lists In Cells</h3>
			<p>
				So... 
				In another sheet I will have two drop down lists to select
				a row and select a column:
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_table_test_score_want_list.PNG" 
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet"/>
			<p>
				So we need <tt>B1</tt> to be a drop down list with the student names
				from our table and <tt>B2</tt> to be a drop down list with the 
				subject titles from our table. To accomplish this we do the following (also shown in the image below)...
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select the <tt>B1</tt> cell and then</li>
				<li>Select the &quot;Data&quot; tab in the ribbon and</li>
				<li>Drop down the &quot;Data Validation&quot; menu and click on &quot;Data Validation&quot;.</li>
			</ol>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_add_data_validation_steps.PNG"
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet showing how to add Data Validation">
			<p>
				Having done this, the Data Validation dialog will show.  This will
				allow us to restrict the data that can be entered into this cell.
				We want to 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Restrict the user input to values in a drop down list so
				    we must select &quot;List&quot; in the &quot;Allow:&quot; field, 
				</li>
				<li>Select which values appear in our drop down. For that you
				    click on the little icon to the right of the &quot;Source:&quot;
					 input box (<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_select_icon.PNG" style="vertical-align: -3px;"/>).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This is shown in the image below:
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_validation_dialog.PNG" 
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet Data Validation Dialog Window"/>
			<p>
				Having clicked the data select box (<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_select_icon.PNG" style="vertical-align: -3px;"/>) 
				you must then select, from the table in your excel worksheet,
				the row containing the student names. This is shown below (selected cells highlighted in yellow):
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_select_table_row_headers.PNG"/>
			<p>
				Once you have selected the student names click the &quot;finish&quot; button
				(<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_select_finish_icon.PNG" style="vertical-align: -3px;"/>) to go back 
				to the Data Validation dialog, as shown below.
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_validation_dialog_completed.PNG" 
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet Data Validation Dialog Window"/>
			<ol><li>You will notice that the range you selected is now in the &quot;Source:&quot; field.</li>
				<li>Lastly click OK.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Now you will see in your spreadsheet that cell <tt>B1</tt>, where we
				want the user to enter the student name is a drop down list containing
				all the student names from our matrix. Now the user is constrained to
				entering only the available names, which is what we wanted.
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_cell_now_student_dtopdown.PNG" 
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet with dropdown list in cell"/>
			<p>
				Exactly the same process needs to be repeated for the test names to
				create a dropdown in the cell <tt>B2</tt>. This time when you select
				the list contents you will select the row labels of the matrix. This
				is summarised in the image below:
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_summarise_for_subject_list.PNG" 
			     alt="Screenshot of Excel spreadsheet summarising creating dropdown list"/>
			<ol>
				<li>Select the cell <tt>B2</tt>,</li>
				<li>Select the &quot;Data&quot; tab on the ribbon and select &quot;Data Validation..&quot; 
				    from the &quot;Data Validation&quot; drop down icon so that the data validation dialog displays,</li>
				<li>Select &quot;List&quot; from the &quot;Allow:&quot; field,</li>
				<li>Click the data select box (<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_select_icon.PNG" style="vertical-align: -3px;"/>),</li>
				<li>Navigate to the worksheet containing the table and select the row labels
				    for the subject names,</li>
				<li>Select the finish button (<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_data_select_finish_icon.PNG" style="vertical-align: -3px;"/>),</li>
				<li>The range selected appears back in the data validation dialog,</li>
				<li>Click OK,</li>
				<li>Done: the result is that cell <tt>B2</tt> is now a drop down list containing the test names from the table.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Looking Up A Table</h3>
			<p>
				The user is now able to tell us what student and what subject she
				wants the test score for. Now we need to lookup the table using this
				information.
			</p>
			<p>
				As far as I know, Excel doesn't have a function that will directly
				do this for us, but it does have a table lookup function called 
				<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/VLOOKUP-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1"
					target="_blank"><tt>VLOOKUP()</tt></a> 
				that will look up values in a table based on a
				value found in the index <em>row</em>. This function falls short
				in that to select the column an integer column number must be used.
				In order to go from column heading to column number we will use
				another function, 
				<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/MATCH-function-e8dffd45-c762-47d6-bf89-533f4a37673a"
				   target="_blank"><tt>MATCH()</tt></a>.
			</p>
			<h4>Looking Up A Table By Row</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/VLOOKUP-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1"
					target="_blank"><tt>VLOOKUP()</tt></a> will look for a value in the <em>first</em>
				column of a table. Thus the &quot;key&quot; that you are using 
				<em>has to be in the left most column of your table</em>. Given how we've laid
				out the table, we're ok.
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>VLOOKUP()</tt> works as follows:<br/> 
				<tt>VLOOKUP(<i>value</i>, <i>table</i>, <i>column</i>, <i>search type</i>)</tt>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><tt><i>value</i></tt> is the value, in the left most column of the table, that you
				    want to find, i.e., index your table rows by,</li>
				<li><tt><i>table</i></tt> is the rectangular block of cells that constitute your table,</li>
				<li><tt><i>column</i></tt> is the column that you want to look up. The column in the row that contained
				    <tt><i>value</i></tt> is the value that the function will return.</li>
				<li><tt><i>search type</i></tt> specifies whether your do an exact search (TRUE),
				    where the function will search all cells in the first column for an <em>exact</em>
				    value, or non-exact (FALSE)
				    where the data in the first column of your table <em>must</em> be sorted and
				    the function will return the closest match.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This is shown pictorially in the image below...
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_vlookup.PNG" alt="Picture describing VLOOKUP() functionality"/>
			<p>
				In the above example we are looking for &quot;Economics&quot; in the table (red border).
				<tt>VLOOKUP</tt> finds economics in row 3. It then goes along row 3, to column 4 (which 
				we also specified in the function call - the orange highlight) in 
				the table and returns the value in that cell.
			</p>
			<p>
				Okay, so now we can look up our table by row. We would simply place the string
				&quot;Economics&quot; in our function call with the cell reference of the
				cell that contains the user entered value... in the case of this example,
				cell <tt>B2</tt>. Thus, the function now becomes <tt>VLOOKUP(B2, A1:D4, 4, FALSE)</tt>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is great but we still cannot find the score for any student. Currently
				we hav a fixed column index of 4, which will look up scores for Amy only...
			</p>
			<h4>Finding Column Index From Heading</h4>
			<p>
				Cell <tt>B1</tt> lets the user pick a student. The question is, how do
				we go from the students name to the column number in our table for that
				student? Enter the <tt>MATCH()</tt> function.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <tt>MATCH()</tt> function will search for an item in a list
				and return the <em>position</em> of the item in the list as a number.
				The numbering start from 1.
			</p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_match_example.PNG" alt="Example of Excel's MATCH() function working"/>
			<p>
				The image above shows an example of how <tt>MATCH()</tt> works. The yellow highlight
				shows the row of cells we have used as our array. The blue boxed numbers indicate
				the numerical positions of each of the values in the array: each cell acts
				as an element of the array. We have told <tt>MATCH()</tt> to find
				the value &quot;C&quot; in our array and return its position, which
				you can see it does: 3 is returned.
			</p>
			<h4>Bringing It Together!</h4>
			<p>
				So, we're getting there! Now, to tie this to our example in stead of
				searching for &quot;C&quot; we would search for the value contained
				in cell <tt>B1</tt>. Thus to get from student name to column number
				we want to use <tt>MATCH(B1, A1:D1, 0)</tt>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But wait?! Why is <tt>A1</tt> in our array?! Cell <tt>A1</tt> is
				empty, but we want this so that the first student name has an
				index of 2 in our array, as this is the column number for the first
				student as far as our <tt>VLOOKUP()</tt> is concerned.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, pluggin this into our <tt>VLOOKUP()</tt>, the equation for
				the result cell becomes <tt><b>=VLOOKUP(B2,'Data Matrix'!A1:D4,MATCH(B1,'Data Matrix'!A1:D1,0), FALSE)</b></tt>.

		<h2>Comparing Dates</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Wanted to count number of tests that occurred on a specific date.
			   Ans: Create a column with formula as follows.
			</p>
			<pre>=IF(F2=<b>DATEVALUE</b>("16/5/2016"),1,0)</pre>
			<p>
			Note the use of the <tt>DATEVALUE</tt> function. Then just sum the column.
			</p>

		<h2>Firing Events When A Cell Is Clicked</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				I had a spreadsheet with a set of results. Column A has a filename,
				column B has a path to a file as named in column A, and column C has 
				a different path to a file as named in column A. I want to click the
				file name and then open two images: <tt>pathInColumn(B) + a</tt> and
				<tt>pathInColumn(C) + a</tt>. The image below demonstrates this a 
				little more clearly...
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_click_cell_load_img.png" alt="Microsoft Excel spreadsheet showing that I want to click a cell and catch cell click event"/>
			<p>
				To accomplish this I had a bit of a Google and the following is 
				based on these two links.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.vbaexpress.com/forum/showthread.php?32461-how-to-open-a-file-with-Win-Photo-Viewer"
					target="_blank">VBAExpress: How to open a file with Windows Photo Viewer</a>, answer by user &quot;mdmackillop&quot;.
				</li>
				<li><a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/run-event-ms-excel-cell-selected-40335.html" 
					target="_blank">How to Run an Event in MS Excel If a Cell Is Selected</a>.
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff838238.aspx"
					target="_blank">MS Excel Range Object</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To do this, first save your spreadsheet as a macro-enabled spreadsheet.
				It will have a <tt>.xlsm</tt> extension. Load the VBA console from
				the developer tab.
			</p>
			<p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_load_vba_window.png" alt="Loading the VBA developer window from Excel"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				In the VBA editor, in the Project explorer view on the left hand side of the window, 
				select the VBA project for you workbook and drill down to select the worksheet
				you wish to catch cell selection events for. Double click the work sheet and
				an editor window is display. In the editor window, select from the top left
				drop down box "Worksheet". This is shown in the image below...
			</p>
			<p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_load_vba_worksheet_events.png" alt="Load VBA for worksheet in Excel"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have selected &quot;Worksheet&quot; the editor will
				automatically fill in a template for the <tt>Worksheet_SelectionChange</tt>
				event. This function is called every time a new cell receives focus.
				The parameter <tt>Target</tt> is an MS Excel <tt>range</tt> object that
				can be used to find out which cell(s) have been selected by the user.
			</p>
			<p>
			<img src="##IMG_DIR##/excel_selection_change.png" alt="Excel Worksheet_SelectionChange function"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that we have the shell of the function, we need to fill it in. Use
				the code below:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim fname1 As String
    Dim fname2 As String
    If Intersect(Range("A1:A1"), Target) Is Nothing Then
        If Not Intersect(Range("A:A"), Target) Is Nothing Then
            If Target.Count = 1 And Not IsEmpty(Target.Value) Then
                fname1 = Target.Cells(1, 2) + "\" + Target.Value + ".png"
                fname2 = Target.Cells(1, 2) + "\" + Target.Value + ".png"

                ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink "file://" + fname1
                ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink "file://" + fname2
            End If
        End If
    End If
End Sub</pre>
		<p>
			The first <tt>If</tt> statement makes sure that the selection is not
			in the first row of column A as this is our table header. The function
			<tt>Intersect()</tt> checks if the range <tt>A1:A1</tt> which is our
			header row is part of the range defined by <tt>Target</tt> which is 
			the cells that the user has selected.
		</p>
		<p>
			And so on...
