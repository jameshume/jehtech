# Different Mobile Comms Standards

|    | Standards                         | Technology | SMS | Voice Switching | Data Switching    | Data Rates   |
|----|-----------------------------------|------------|-----|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1G | AMPS, TACS                        | Analog     | No  | Circuit         | Circuit           | N/A          |
| 2G | GSM, CDMA, EDGE, GPRS             | Digital    | Yes | Circuit         | Circuit / Packet+ | 236.8 kbps   |

+ GPRS is a packet-switched network and GSM is a circuit-switched network [[Ref]](https://byjus.com/gate/difference-between-gsm-and-gprs/#:~:text=The%20GSM%20is%20a%20circuit,packet%2Dswitched%20type%20of%20network.&text=The%20GSM%20technology%20provides%20a,for%20all%20of%20its%20users.)

* GSM = Global Systems for Mobile
    * Standard bearer of 2G tech,
    * Introduced Simple Messaging Service (SMS),
    * Circuit switched,
    * Can make voice calls and transmit data at the same time.
* GPRS = General Packet Radio Service
    * Standard bearer of 2.5G tech
    * Upgrade to GSM,
    * Packet switched,
    * Introduced Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS),
    * Can make voice calls and transmit data at the same time.
* CDMA = Code Division Multiple Access
    * Can *_not_* make voice calls and transmit data at the same time,
    * GSM is widely used across the world, CDMA is mostly only common in the US
* EDGE = Enhanced Data Rate for FSM Evolution
    * Improves upon the GSM/GPRS family: higher bit-rates per radio channel.
    * Completes with UTMS
* UTMS = Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
    * Fully compatible with GSM
    * Competes with EDGE
