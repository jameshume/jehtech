		<pre class="linenums prettyprint">sudo apt-get install subversion --upgrade</pre>

<!-- --------------------------- SECTION BEGIN --------------------------- -->
<h2>Diffs</h2>
<div>
		<h3>On The Fly Diff Tool</h3>
		<p>
			To use a specific diff tool from the command line use:
		</p>
		<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn diff some.file --diff-cmd meld
svn diff some.file --diff-cmd kdiff3
etc...</pre>

		<h3>Make SVN use P4Merge For Diff</h3>
		<p>I really like the <a href="http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools" target="_blank">
		   Perforce merge and diff tools</a> so after a bit of searching
		   around now use the following script on my Linux box</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh linenums">#!/bin/sh

LEFT_FILE_DESCR=$3
RIGHT_FILE_DESCR=$5
LEFT=$6
RIGHT=$7

echo STARTING DIFF
echo LEFT IS  "$LEFT_FILE_DESCR"
echo RIGHT IS "$RIGHT_FILE_DESCR"
p4merge -nl "$LEFT_FILE_DESCR" -nr "$RIGHT_FILE_DESCR" "$LEFT" "$RIGHT"</pre>
    <p>Save the above script somewhere on your <tt>PATH</tt>. I called it <tt>p4_diff_helper.sh</tt>. Then in the subversion config file (<tt>~/.subversion/config</tt> for linux and <tt>%appdata%\subversion\config</tt> for windows) add in the diff command under the [helpers] section.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">[helpers]
&lt;snip&gt;
### Set diff-cmd to the absolute path of your 'diff' program.
###  diff-cmd = diff_program (diff, gdiff, etc.)
###  diff-cmd = kdiff3
diff-cmd = p4_diff_helper.sh</pre>

		<p>
			This took me quite a while the first time round, reading on various threads, then I found out that the
			&quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.externaldifftools.html">Using External Differencing and Merge Tools</a>&quot;
			section of the Red Book had the answer all along, so use that link for more information :)
		</p>

		<p>Doing the same for a merge is even easier:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh linenums">#!/bin/sh
BASE=$1
THEIRS=$2
MINE=$3
MERGED=$4
WCPATH=$5
p4merge "$BASE" "$MINE" "$THEIRS" "$MERGED"</pre>

		<p>
			Again, assuming you save the above on the <tt>PATH</tt> as
			<tt>p4_merge_helper.sh</tt>, modify the subversion config file
			(<tt>~/.subversion/config</tt> for linux and <tt>%appdata%\subversion\config</tt> for windows) add in the merge command under the [helpers]
			section.
		</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">[helpers]
&lt;snip&gt;
merge-tool-cmd = p4_merge_helper.sh</pre>
</div>

<!-- --------------------------- SECTION BEGIN --------------------------- -->
		<h2>SVN Log</h2>
		<h3>Only Report Changes After Branch</h3>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">snv log --stop-on-copy </pre>
		<h3>Get More Merge Information</h3>
		<p>
			Use the <tt><b>-g</b></tt> flag (and also useful is the verbosity flag <tt><b>-v</b></tt>)
			to get more information in the log dump. The <tt>-g</tt> flag adds extra
			information into the trace for instances where merges where made back into
			the line, or where the line was copied out to another branch.
		</p>
		<h3>Properties</h3>
		<p>
			Too see changes in properties use the following command:
		</p>
		<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn log -v --diff --depth=empty .</pre>
		<p>
			Grep the output for &quot;Modified: svn:externals&quot;
		</p>

		<h2>SVN Ignore Files</h2>
		<p>The following will ignore all *.orig files from the current directory and all subdirectories</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">svn propset svn:ignore '*.orig' . --recursive</pre>
		<p>
			It's usually a good idea to use <code>svn propedit</code> instread of <code>propset</code> if you want
			to ignore many things. To use this make sure you have set your <code>SVN_EDITOR</code> environment
			variable to, for example, <code>gvim -f</code> on Windows or <code>gvim --no-fork</code> on Linux.
		</p>

		<p>
			From SVN 1.8 onwards there is a new property <code>svn:global-ignores</code>:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				global-ignores ... is a whitespace-delimited collection of file patterns. The Subversion client
				checks these patterns against the names of the files that are candidates for addition to version
				control, as well as to unversioned files that the svn status command notices. If any file's name
				matches one of the patterns, Subversion will basically act as if the file didn't exist at all...
			</p>
			<footer>-- Subversion manual</footer>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p>

		<h2>Diffs and Revision Keywords</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Normally, having looked at the log you would diff 2 revisions by executing:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">svn diff -r aaa:bbb</pre>
			<p>
				However, for some easy tasks, there are special revision keywords that can be used <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html#svn.tour.revs.keywords" target="_blank">[Ref]</a> when referring to a <em>working copy path</em>:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>HEAD</code> - The latest commit.</li>
				<li><code>BASE</code> - The revision number of an item in a working copy. If the item has been locally modified, this refers to the way the item appears without those local modifications.</li>
				<li><code>COMMITTED</code> - The most recent revision prior to, or equal to, <code>BASE</code>, in which an item changed.</li>
				<li><code>PREV</code> - <code>COMMITTED - 1</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For example:
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">$ svn diff -r PREV:COMMITTED foo.c
# shows the last change committed to foo.c</pre>
		</div>

		<h2>Branch, Checkout, Merge and Reintegrate</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Branching &amp; Checkout</h3>
			<p>
				From SVN manual: <q>Subversion has no internal concept of a branch
				- it knows only how to make copies ... that happens to carry
				some extra historical information.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				To branch off, for example trunk, to new workshpace:
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn cp svn+ssh://myserver.com/trunk/src svn+ssh://myserver.com/0_developers/my_name/branch_name -m "a description"
cd /where/you/want/to/checkout/to
svn co svn+ssh://myserver.com/0_developers/my_name/branch_name</pre>

			<h3>Checkout At Specific Revision</h3>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn up -r1234</pre>

			<h3>Merging</h3>
			<p>
				To update my local branch with changes from trunk make sure branch is cleann no local modifications and up to date.
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">cd /where/you/want/to/checkout/to
svn merge ^/trunk/src</pre>
			<p>
				<em>Note that this has only affected your working copy!</em> The changes have <em>not</em> been submitted to
				the repository yet. For that you must do an <tt>svn commit</tt>. This is also known as a <em>sync merge</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
			<a name="mergeinfo_tips1">Useful tips from the Red Book...</a>
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn mergeinfo --show-revs=merged ^/trunk ^/branches/0_developers/my_name/branch_name
svn mergeinfo --show-revs=eligible ^/trunk ^/branches/0_developers/my_name/branch_name</pre>
			<p>
				The first line reports a summary of changelists where trunk was merged to branch. The
				second line reports a summary of changelists where trunk has not yet been merged to branch
			</p>
			<p>
				If a merge doesn't work out and you have <em>not yet committed it</em>, to revert the merge just use:
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn revert -R .</pre>

			<h3>Reintegrating</h3>
			<p>
				To re-integrate to trunk, first make sure dev-line is up to date by merging in from trunk again and
				<em>committing</em> any changes resulting from the merge back to the repo.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't forget the <b><tt>--dry-run</tt></b> flag... tries the operation,
				shows you the output, but make no actual changes. It's a nice way to
				see what your merge will do before you actually do it!
			</p>

			<h4>Pre v1.8</h4>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">cd /where/truck/is/checked/out
svn up
svn merge <b>--reintegrate</b> ^/0_developers/my_name/branch_name
... test ...
svn commit -m "message"</pre>
			<p>
				For subversion &lt; v1.8, the <tt>--reintegrate</tt> option is critical for reintegrating changes from a branch back into
				its original line of development so that only changes unique to your branch are copied back!
			</p>
			<p>
				<div class="box_container">
					<div class="warning">
						<p>
							Pre v1.8:  The [--reintegrate] option is critical for reintegrating changes from a branch back into its original line of development—don't forget it! ... By specifying the --reintegrate option, you're asking Subversion to carefully replicate only those changes unique to your branch.

			<h3>Resolving Conflicts</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" target="_blank">This section</a> of the Red Book covers this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7679113/differences-between-svn-merge-left-right-working-files-after-conflicts" target="_blank">This
                SO thread</a> discusses the difference between left, right, working etc in merge conflicts.
			</p>

			<h3>Evil Twins</h3>
			<p>
				Evil twins are two files with the same name and location in two different
				branches that do not have a common ancestor. For example, if <tt>B</tt> was a branch
				of <tt>A</tt> and in <tt>A</tt> I create the file <tt>dummy.txt</tt>, then file-copy (<em>not</em>
				<tt>svn cp</tt>) that file into <tt>B</tt> and then try to reintegrate <tt>B</tt> to <tt>A</tt>, SVN will
				throw a wobbly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why is this? It is basically because SVN has absolutely no way to know
				how to merge these files. Who's correct? <tt>A</tt> or <tt>B</tt>? The
				files might look similar, but may not be even related! Had there been
				a common ancestor at least SVN would know they're related and could have
				a stab at a merge.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then this is the case it is best to pospone resolution of the conflict
				and compare the two files. Your only option will probably to be to
				accept the working copy as the file to keep. Then you will have to manually
				edit that working copy file to reflect the changes that you want to keep
				between the evil twins.
			</p>
			<p>
				To do this you use...
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn resolve --accept='working' file-name</pre>
			<p>
				This removes the conflict marker and says that the working copy contains
				the resolved file. (At this point, note however that it does NOT!).
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you need to manually resolve the changes. Edit the working copy or
				overwrite it. Then when you commit the working copy will become the
				updated file in <tt>A</tt>. Note, that if you use <tt>B</tt> further
				you still face the same problem on the next merge. The best thing to do
				would be to remove the bopy in <tt>B</tt> and replace it with a <em>
				branch</em> from <tt>A</tt>.
			</p>

			<h3>See Merge History</h3>
			<p>
				Use the command <tt><b>svn mergeinfo <i>src_branch targ_branch</i></b></tt>.
				It will print an ascii-art graph of the merge history between
				the two branches.
			</p>
			<p>
				See also these <a href="#mergeinfo_tips1">tips in merge section</a>.
			</p>

		<h2>Rollback To A Previous Revision</h2>
		<p>
			From your repo directory use the following, which is described in the svb redbook
			<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>

		<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn update
svn merge -r &lt;newer-rev&gt;:&lt;older-rev&gt; <i>&lt;filename or . for current dir&gt;</i>
svn commit</pre>

		<p>
			As the manual says....
			<q>You can use svn merge to &quot;undo&quot; the change in your working copy, and then commit the local modification to the repository. All you need to do is to specify a reverse difference. (You can do this by specifying <tt>--revision 392:391</tt>, or by an equivalent <tt>--change -392</tt>.)</q>
		</p>

		<h2>SVN Properties - Recursive</h2>
		<p>
			Arg! Setting the ignore property recursively is deceptive. The problem and
			several really good answers are found in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764521/recursive-svn-propset"
				target="_blank">this SO thread</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another useful command is <b><tt>svn plist -v <i>branch</i></tt></b> to see
			all the properties set on a directory or file.
		</p>

		<h2>Externals</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Can kinda emulate Perforce client specs, but either way are pretty useful
				if you want your development line to include other bits of code from
				different development lines. I.e. <q>...contruct a working copy that
				is made out of a number of different checkouts</q>. When a branch
				has externals, after the branch is checked out or updated, subversion
				will also automatically chekout/update the external items into the
				working copy.
			</p>
			<p>
				To set up externals use the svn property <b><tt>svn:externals</tt></b>.
				As the manual points out, it is a <b>multiline property</b> so best use
				<tt>svn prop<b>edit</b></tt> as oppsed to <tt>svn propset</tt>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The manual also recommends using <em>explicit revisions</em> in
				your external definitions so that the snapshot of the external soruce
				is <em>well controlled</em> and you don't get unexpected updates
				to external code that you may not control. Note that this does mean,
				however, that you will <em>not</em> be able to modify the external.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you do modify an external, you must explicity commit the external.
				<b>Doing a commit on the &quot;mother&quot; checkout will <em>not</em>
				recurse into the externals</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the external definition references something in the same repository
				it is also good practice to use paths relative to the root of the
				repository. I.e. paths prefixed with &quot;<tt>^/</tt>&quot;.
			</p>
			<p>
				The format for the <tt>svn:externals</tt> property is this:
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">^/path/to/external[@<i>revision</i>] local/path</pre>
			<p>
				Or...
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">[-r <i>revision</i>] ^/path/to/external local/path</pre>
			<p>
				<B>WARNING:</B> When you do an <code>svn diff</code> you will not see diffs for externals. To get these diffs you will have to do an <code>svn status</code> and
				grep for &quot;^M&quot;:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">svn status | grep "^\s*[MAD]" | sed -e "s/^M\s*//g" | while read fn; do svn diff "$fn"; done</pre>
			<p>
				<b>WARNING</b>: Just like for diffs, you generally do not affect or get information on externals.
				Any other command other than the <code>svn checkout</code>, <code>svn update</code>, <code>svn switch</code>, and <code>svn status</code> commands, will usually skip externals. This means that <b>when you merge from one branch to another, externals are <em>not</em> merged! You have to do
				these seperately!</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				This can lead to problems if, for example, you haven't checked out your development branch from the root (perhaps its a massive repo and you didn't want to check it all out). This is shown below and assumes the externals are relative paths inside the one repo that do not speciify specific revisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/svn_merge_externals.png" alt="SVN merging a repo with externals"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The solution would be to checkout the development branch at its root, rather than a subdirectory, as shown above. However, if the real repo is really massive you might not want to do that do a <a href="#sparse-checkout">sparse checkout</a> with only the modified externals will do.
			</p>
			<p>
				To quickly see all the externals in a repo you could try something like the following:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">find . -type d -a -not -path \*/.svn\* -print | \
    while read f; do \
        svn propget svn:externals "$f" >.svnproptmp 2>&1 && \
        echo "$f" && \
        cat -b .svnproptmp && \
        rm .svnproptmp; \
    done</pre>
		</div> <!-- END: H2 Externals -->

		<h2>My Repository Moved!</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Recently a repository I had checked out was moved for various reasons. I still had some
				files in my checkout that were modified so I didn't want to have to re-checkout from
				the new location and manually add these edits. Solution was the command
				<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svn.c.relocate.html" target="_blank"><code>svn relocate</code></a>.
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX</pre>
		</div>

		<a id="sparse-checkout"></a>
		<h2>Sparse Checkouts</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				See <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.sparsedirs.html" target="_blank">docs</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When dealing with really large repositories, you may not need to check out the <i>entire</i> repository. If this is the
				case you can use a &quot;sparse&quot; checkout. To do this type:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">svn checkout --depth=immediates https://your.repo/root checkout_dir</pre>
			<p>
				This will only check out the immediate files at the root of your repository and will <i>not</i> recurse into
				subdirectories. This means that files in the root directory are checked out and directories in the root are
				created, but their contents are not filled.
			</p>
			<p>
				For directories that you need, you can then change into them (maybe applying the sparse checkout recursively to selctively get subdirectories), and type:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">svn update --set-depth=infinity</pre>
			<p>
				Other targets of use:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><code>--depth empty</code><br/>
				   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include only the immediate target of the operation, not any of its file or directory children.</p>
				<p><code>--depth files</code><br/>
				   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include the immediate target of the operation and any of its immediate file children.</p>
				<p><code>--depth immediates</code><br/>
				   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include the immediate target of the operation and any of its immediate file or directory children. The directory children will themselves be empty.</p>
				<p><code>--depth infinity</code><br/>
				   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include the immediate target, its file and directory children, its children's children, and so on to full recursion.</p>

		<h2>Misc</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Generate And Restore A Patch File</h3>
			<p>
				Useful when uploading diffs to ReviewBoard for example. Use the following:
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn diff --internal-diff --patch-compatible -rX:Y &gt; patch.diff</pre>
			<p>
				Note the use of the <tt>--internal-diff</tt>. If your SVN config file
				specifies a diff tool other than the internal SVN diff tool your patch
				won't be generated. This option ensures that the SVN internal diff tool
				is used to the patch file comes out right. Also notice <tt>--patch-compatible</tt>.
				This will make sure new, previously non-existent, files are added to the diff. (You
				might then have to edit the resulting patch file to replace the text <tt>(nonexistent)</tt>
				with <tt>(revision 0)</tt>).
			</p>
			<p>
				To restore a patch do:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">patch &lt; patch.diff</pre>
			<p></p>

			<h3>Check Your SSH Connection</h3>
			<p>
				If your are having trouble with your SSH connection, you can check
				that your keys are correctly loaded using the following command (on
				Linux with OpenSSH) to list your loaded keys...
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">ssh-add -L</pre>
			<p>
				If you're still having problems look in <tt>~/.subversion/config</tt> and
				go to the <tt>[tunnels]</tt> section. In the SSH command take out the
				<tt>-q</tt> option to get better debug messages to the console.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>OR...</b> even better just type...
			</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">export SVN_SSH=&quot;ssh -v &quot;</pre>
			<p>
				...either on the same line as your svn command to just apply it
				to that command, or on a line by its own to make the setting
				apply to all svn commands. (Note the trailing space after the -v).
			</p>

			<h3>Add all untracked files</h3>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn add $(svn status | grep ? | awk '{print $2}')</pre>

			<h3>Diff all changes in changeset</h3>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint">svn diff -c &lt;changeset&gt; [filename]</pre>
			<p>This is the same as running the following:</p>
			<pre class="linenums prettyprint"> svn diff -r rev-1:rev [filename]</pre>
			<p>If <tt>filename</tt> is ommitted all changes in that changeset
			are examined</p>

			<h3>Nice Diff Syntax For Same-File-Different-Branch</h3>
			<p>Useful command example is:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums">svn diff ^/branches/{PATH_1,PATH_2}/some/repo/path</pre>
			<p>Where:</p>
			<ul><li><tt>^/</tt> is a shortcut for the root of the current repository, and</li>

			<h3>Diff Two Paths But Select Exactly What To Diff</h3>
			</a>

			<p>
				I found it really useful to take a summary of SVN diffs, delete
				the stuff I wasn't interested in and then only diff the remaining
				when considering two paths, one being a branch of the other...
			</p>
			<p>
				Lets say that branch 1 was at this location:
				<tt>svn+ssh://your.server.xxx/subversion/branches/branch_A"</tt>
			</p>
			<p>
				And lets say that branch 2 was at this location:
				<tt>svn+ssh://your.server.xxx/subversion/branches/branch_B/some/other/path"</tt>
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I could use the following script. It would summarise the
				differences to a file. I could then cull any files I didn't want
				to diff for whatever reason, save the file, exit the editor and
				then diff what I'd left in the file...
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh linenums">#!/bin/bash
svnroot="svn+ssh://your.server.xxx/subversion/branches/"

b2="branch_B/some/other/path"
