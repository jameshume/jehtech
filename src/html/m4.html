<h2>Macro Names</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		Macro names, or tokens, are any sequence of characters that must start with either an underscore or a letter followed by alphnumerical characters.
		Anything that does not match this terminates the token and is just passed straight to the output. So <code>TOK1  TOK2</code> are two seperate tokens
		as are <code>TOK1.TOK2</code>, <code>TOK1()TOK2</code> and so on...
	</p>
</div>

<h2>Macro Expansion, Quoting &amp; Parameters</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		Its's worth noting that the following examples are a little contrived but should serve to show how evaluation and expansion of tokens
		occurs. Aso note that <em>define parameters are usually quoted and preceeded by a dnl, but for these examples we wont do this</em>.
	</p>
	<h3>Expansion</h3>
	<p>
		As the input is read, each token is checked to see if it is a macro. If it is, it is expanded. The result is then re-scanned and macro
		expansion is applied recusively. This is also true for macro parameters/arguments: they are recursively expanded before being &quot;passed&quot; to
		the macro.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can investigate this by turning on M4's debug features. The following examples will demonstrate both recurive macro expansion
		and recursive macro parameter expansion.
	</p>

		<h4>The Most Basic Expansion</h4>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-m linenums">$ m4 --debug=V -
<b>define(XXX, joey)</b>
m4trace:stdin:21: -1- id 23: define ...                    <b>| The token 'define' is seen.</b>
m4trace:stdin:21: -1- id 23: define(`XXX', `joey') -> ???  <b>| It is a known macro so the following tokens are parameters. What does it expand to?</b>
m4trace:stdin:21: -1- id 23: define(...)                   <b>| No furher expansion possible to expands to what it is, pass to interpretter.</b>
                                                           <b>| Mapping XXX -> joey added to macro table</b>

<b>XXX says hello</b>
m4trace:stdin:22: -1- id 24: XXX ...
m4trace:stdin:22: -1- id 24: XXX -> ???
m4trace:stdin:22: -1- id 24: XXX -> `joey'
joey says hello</pre>
		<p></p>

		<h4>Recusive Macro Expansion</h4>
		<p>
			A slightly different example:
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-m linenums">$ m4 --debug=V -
<b>define(play,dodge)</b>
m4trace:stdin:1: -1- id 1: define ...                           <b>| The normal define stuff here....</b>
m4trace:stdin:1: -1- id 1: define(`play', `dodge') -> ???
m4trace:stdin:1: -1- id 1: define(...)

<b>define(dodgeball, HURTS)</b>
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 2: define ...
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 2: define(`dodgeball', `HURTS') -> ???
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 2: define(...)

<b>play()ball</b>
m4trace:stdin:3: -1- id 3: play ...                             <b>| First token is play</b>
m4trace:stdin:3: -1- id 3: play(`') -> ???                      <b>| Its identified as a macro and implicity passed the empty string</b>
m4trace:stdin:3: -1- id 3: play(...) -> `dodge'                 <b>| The macro evaluates to &quot;dodge&quot; and is expanded as such</b>
m4trace:stdin:3: -1- id 4: dodgeball ...                        <b>| After expansion the input is now &quot;dodgeball&quot;</b>
m4trace:stdin:3: -1- id 4: dodgeball -> ???                     <b>| <i>Recurively</i> re-evaluate the input for futher expansions</b>
m4trace:stdin:3: -1- id 4: dodgeball -> `HURTS'                 <b>| A further expansion is possible... the input is now just one token</b>
HURTS                                                           <b>| For which a mapping exists, so the final output is this!</div>
		</pre>

		<p>The GNU manual explains it like so:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				When the arguments, if any, to a macro call have been collected, the macro is expanded, and the expansion text is pushed
				back onto the input (unquoted), and reread. The expansion text from one macro call might therefore result in more macros
				being called, if the calls are included, completely or partially, in the first macro calls’ expansion.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p></p>

	<h3>Quoting</h3>
	<p>
		The opening quote character is the backtick (<code>`</code>) and the closing quote character is the 
		apostrophe (<code>'</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The main use of quotes is to <b>defer the expansion of tokens/macros</b>, but they are also used to do things like
		write &quot;james,john&quot; as one single token, which would otherwise be two tokens in a define, for example. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The GNU M4 manual has this to say about quoting:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			The value of a string token is the text, with one level of quotes stripped off. Thus
		</p>
		<pre>`'
⇒
is the empty string, and double-quoting turns into single-quoting.

``quoted''
⇒`quoted'</pre>
		<p></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I like the WikiPedia explanation better:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Unquoted identifiers which match defined macros are replaced with their definitions. Placing identifiers in quotes suppresses expansion until possibly later, such as when a quoted string is expanded as part of macro replacement.
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		So, bearing this definition in mind, considering our examples so far, without quotes we might write	something like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-m linenums">$ m4 -
define(jehtech, bob)dnl
...
... A shed load of code later in the file we forgot about the jehtech macro define!... 
...
define(bob, eric)dnl  <b>| The intension here is that jehtech should still translate to bob, but this will stop that!</b>
jehtech               <b>| The user inputs the string jehtech</b>   
eric                  <b>| But gets eric and not bob as s/he might expect. We have seen why in the above sections</b></pre>
	<p>
		The user's intension was probably not to have the string &quot;jehtech&quot; suddenly expand to &quot;eric&quot; as in 
		this example we imagine there are several pages, perhaps, of code between the define for &quot;jehtech&quot; and the 
		define for &quot;bob&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		This behvaiour is suprising to the user and not particularly useful. So how do we stop this? The answer is <em>using
		quotes to defer the expansion of tokens</em>. But remember what we saw in the previous section as to how the parameter
		&quot;bob&quot; was expanded to &quot;jehtech&quot; before it was passed to the define macro. Lets try quoting things
		and see if we get the expected answer...

	<p>
		So, the quoting didn't change the end result! But, it did stop the suprise expansion of the define parameters. This <em>is 
			why parameters to define's are generally quoted</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, really this is now behaving how we want it. The expansion should be recusively done like this. What shouldn't happen is
		the expansion of the define parameters before the define is evaluated, so we've done our job.
	</p>
	<p>
		But, for interest, lets just say we didn't want the recursive expansion to happen. How do we stop that? The answer is
		still quotes.

<h2>Why Is There A &quot;dnl&quot; At The End Of So Many &quot;define&quot;s?</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		In M4 the input string is parsed and any macros are expanded (recursively) before being passed to the output and
		<code>define(sym, val)</code> is itself a macro that expands to the empty string whilse having the important
		side effect of recording the mapping to <code>sym</code> to <code>val</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This means that where <code>define(`some_name', `some_val')</code> appears in the code an empty string results.
		As a newline normally follows the statement, an empty string and a newline, i.e., a blank line appears in the output,
		which is often not wanted - want the <code>define</code> to just disappear leaving absolutely no trace.
	</p>
	<p>
		The macro <code>dnl</code> eats all whitespace occuring after it AND the newline. So it can be used like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint lang-m linenums">$ m4 -
define('jehtech', 'www.jeh-tech.com')
	
dnl This is the next line. As the define evaluates to the empty string a blank line appears in the output.
dnl We can get around this as follows...


define('jehtech', 'www.jeh-tech.com')dnl
dnl Now this is the next line - no blank line as dnl has eaten all whitespace after it AND the newline</pre>
		<p></p>
</div>

<h2>Conditionals</h2>
<div>
	<p>Macros can be conditionally expanded using the predefines  <code>ifdef</code>,	which tests if a macro is defined,
		 <code>ifelse</code>, which is an if-then-else like functionality and <code>shift</code>, which helps enable recursion.
	</p>

	<h3>Ifdef</h3>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-m">$ m4 -
ifdef(`some_macro', `yes', `no')
no
define(`some_macro', `some text')dnl
ifdef(`some_macro', `yes', `no')
yes</pre>

		<h3>Ifelse</h3>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-m">$ m4 -
ifelse(`some string', `some string', `matches')
matches
ifelse(`some string', `some other string', `matches')

ifelse(`some string', `some other string', `matches', `different')
different</pre>
			<p>
				Above are the most common variations. Note that the does-not-match, 4<sup>th</sup> parameter, is optional. When it
				is ommitted and no match occurs the <code>ifelse</code> macro expands to the empty string.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note again, <code>ifelse</code> is a macro. It is <em>not</em> a function! It just expands to one of its 
				parameters condionally.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>ifelse</code> block, in the form <code>ifelse(a, b, equal_ab)</code> for can be expanded to
				<code>ifelse(a, b, equal_ab, c, d, equal_cd, e, f, equal_ef, ....)</code>. In this case it acts like
				aa <code>if (a == b) equal_ab else if (c == d) equal_cd else if(e == f) equal_ef ... </code>.
			</p>
</div>

<h2>Recursion</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		Because macros are continually expanded we can do boneheaded things like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-m">$ m4 --debug=V -
define(`test', `test')
m4trace:stdin:1: -1- id 1: define ...
m4trace:stdin:1: -1- id 1: define(`test', `test') -> ???
m4trace:stdin:1: -1- id 1: define(...)

test
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 2: test ...
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 2: test -> ???
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 2: test -> `test'
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 3: test ...
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 3: test -> ???
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 3: test -> `test'
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 4: test ...
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 4: test -> ???
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 4: test -> `test'
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 5: test ...
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 5: test -> ???
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 5: test -> `test'
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 6: test ...
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 6: test -> ???
m4trace:stdin:2: -1- id 6: test -> `test'
...
... continues forever repeating the above
...</pre>

		<p>
			That's not useful. But... what if we could get the continual recusive evaluation to end? Now that we
			have contitional evaluation and expansion, we can do this!
		</p>

	<p>Lets try and do something that doesn't break the interpretter:</p>

	<h3>Shift</h3>

		The <code>shift()</code> macro expands to all its arguments except the first:

		This macro is pretty central to recusion. Lets have an attempt at making a reverse macro. (Note there is a native reverse
		macro, so this is just for a play).
	</p>
	<p>
		This was my first attempt:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-m">define(`jump', ifelse($#, 1, end, `jump(shift($@)),$1'))
)</pre>
		<p>
			The first attempt just doesn't work, full stop. The reason is that because the <code>ifelse</code> is not
			quoted, it is immediately expanded due to parameter expansion. A good example of why quoting to defer
			parameter expansion is needed.
		</p>
		<p>
			So... second attempt... quote the <code>ifelse</code>, so the it is not expanded as a parameter to the 
			define macro and instead would be expanded after the define expands. (I've added indents to show the
			level of recusion)

      Oh dear... this produces infinite recursion. The explanation is highlighted above. The problem was that 
      the parameters get continually expanded before they are passed to the macro that would do the parameter
      comparison and end the recursion. Thus, the recursion never ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, how can we stop the parameters being continually expanded before being passed to the macro itself?
      The answer is QUOTING! What we want is for jump to be expanded, but then the arguments to NOT be
      expanded so that the ifelse macro that jump is expanded to has a change to evaluate and compare the 
      first two parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets try with some more quoting...
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-m">define(`jump', <span style="background:moccasin;">`ifelse($#, 1, end, <span style="background:skyblue;">`jump(shift($@)),$1'</span>)'</span>)</pre>
    <p>
      So, now if we input <code>jump(1,2,3)</code>, the macro is expanded to <code>ifelse($#, 1, end, `jump(shift($@)),$1')</code>. BUT NOW
      the 4<sup>th</sup> parameter does NOT get expanded because the quotes defer expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now, the <code>ifelse</code> macro can be expanded BEFORE the last parameter, which will allow it to compare the number of
      arguments to 1, giving it a chance to end the recursion. The output is <code>end,2,1</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the last tweak is to replace &quot;end&quot; with the last parameter. And we'll also use some more quotes to stop
      other things getting unexpectedly expanded. So the final go is this:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-m">define(`jump', `ifelse(`$#', `1', `$1', `jump(shift($@)),$1')')

jump(1,2,3,4)
4,3,2,1</pre>
