        <h2>Middleware &amp; How HTTP Requests Get To A View</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface and is a specification of how a 
                webserver can call a Python framework with an HTTP request and get a response.
            </p>
            <p>
                A WSGI compantible framework will implement a callable object that receives as
                parameters the HTTPRequest object and a callback, which it uses to send the HTTP
                response headers to the server. The function must then return the HTTP reponse
                body as a list of strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The start of the processes, clipped in places, is shown below (I took this from the
                Django 1.11 source code).
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="##IMG_DIR##/django_wsgi_flow_1.png" alt="DJango WSGI flow"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                This doesn't yet show how requests get to a view. That'll come. For now, note that 
                the server will call a core django function, <code>get_wsgi_application()</code>
                that returns a callable object. This object is called and passed a dictionary
                of CGI-like parametrs (key, value pairs) and a callback function. For example the
                dictionary on my machine, when I printed it out, looked something like this:
            </p>
            <pre>&lt;class 'dict'&gt;
{'&lt;snip&gt;
 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE': 'crossfit.settings', 
 'TZ': 'UTC',
 'SERVER_NAME': 'localhost',
 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE': 'CGI/1.1',
 'SERVER_PORT': '8000',
 &lt;snip&gt;
 'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET',
 &lt;snip&gt; }</pre>
            <p>
                The parameters will create an
                HTTPRequest object, and the callback will be used by Django to send the server 
                the HTTP headers that will form the reponse. The called object finally must return
                the HTTP response body as a list of strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/" target="_blank">PEP 3333 -- Python Web Server Gateway Interface</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When <code>get_wsgi_application()</code> is called it returns a callable object.
                The function creates a new instance of a <code>WSGIHandler</code> object. As part
                of its construction the Django middleware is loaded by consulting the
                list of strings, defined by the variable <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> in the 
                <code>settings.py</code> file of your Django project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>WSGIHandler</code>, which is a child of <code>django.core.handlers.base.BaseHandler</code>
                loads the middleware using the <code>BaseHandler</code>. It examimes each middleware 
                object in <code>MIDDLEWARE</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each middleware object can implement some or all of the the functions
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>process_view()</code></li>
                    <li><code>process_template_response()</code></li>
                    <li><code>process_exception()</code></li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                If a middleware object implements a function above, that function is added to
                a list of middleware functions of that type that the handler object caches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The middleware objects must, in addition to the above, form a chain. 
                The first middleware object created will
                point to <code>BaseHandler._get_response()</code>, so it will
                call <code>BaseHandler._get_response</code>. The second middleware object points
                to the first middle ware and so on. 
                Only a reference to the last middleware object therefore needs to be remembered. 
                In this way,
                later on, when the middleware chain is executed, the <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> list
                is essentially executed in reverse order and the very last thing to execute is
                <code>BaseHandler._get_response</code>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the default <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> that Django spits out for me is this:
            </p>
            <pre>MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]</pre>
            <p>
                This means that the following middleware chain is formed:
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="##IMG_DIR##/django_middleware_chain.png"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                So that is how the Django middleware is loaded. That was the arrow in the above
                diagram which went to &quot;nowhere&quot;... it was too much to fit that process
                into the diagram, but thats what was happening :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, so, we've loaded the middleware and created the <code>WSGIHandler</code>
                object, which is returned to the WSGI server, for it to call with the 
                CGI-like variables (environment) and the <code>start_response</code> callback
                function.
            </p>
            <p>
                The big bit is how the HTTP response is generated through the call from
                <code>WSGIHandler</code> to its base class function <code>get_response()</code>.
                Here the fun starts...
            </p>
            <p>The WSGI server calls the WSGIHandler object. One of the first things it does is
                to send a Django-framework signal. Then it 
                takes the dictionary passed to it and converts it into a <code>WSGIRequst</code>
                object. This class mostly seems to extract more important dictionary key/value 
                pairs and presents them as object properties. For example, it might parse a GET
                request's query string and handle cookies etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The meaty bit is the next bit where the respone is processed by calling the base
                class method <code>get_response()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing it does it to call the middleware chain. This means the last
                module defined in the settings <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> list is called, I.e., all
                middleware is a callable of some kind.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems all the middleware include the <code>MiddlewareMixin</code> class which is
                what defines the <code>__call__()</code> function for the middleware object. This
                is found in <code>django.utils.deprecation</code>, so I guess they must be wanting
                to get rid of this pretty soon. Anyway, when a middlware is called it implements
                the following logic:
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="##IMG_DIR##/django_middleware_mixin_logic.png"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the above, it is then unsuprising that when adding a few prints into the
                relevant funtions we see the following output when requesting a page:
            </p>
            <pre>SecurityMiddleware
    Calling process_request SecurityMiddleware
    Calling get_response SecurityMiddleware
SessionMiddleware
    Calling process_request SessionMiddleware
    Calling get_response SessionMiddleware

    Calling get_response CommonMiddleware

    Calling process_request CsrfViewMiddleware
    Calling get_response CsrfViewMiddleware

    Calling process_request AuthenticationMiddleware
    Calling get_response AuthenticationMiddleware
MessageMiddleware
    Calling process_request MessageMiddleware
    Calling get_response MessageMiddleware
XFrameOptionsMiddleware
    Calling get_response XFrameOptionsMiddleware
_GET_RESPONSE CALLED
NO MIDDLE WARE RESPONSE
VIEW view() function called
Request obj is &lt;WSGIRequest: GET '/gym-users/'&gt;
View dispatch(), method is &quot;get&quot;
    Calling process_response XFrameOptionsMiddleware
    Calling process_response MessageMiddleware
    Calling process_response CsrfViewMiddleware
    Calling process_response CommonMiddleware
    Calling process_response SessionMiddleware
    Calling process_response SecurityMiddleware</pre>
            <p>
                An important point is that if any middleware created a
                response in their <code>process_request()</code> method they would break the chain.
                This would presumably be if, for example, the security middleware detected some kind
                of security issue and didn't want the processing of this HTTP request to continue.
                Thus we can say that each middle ware, as well as potentially sanitizing the
                request object can also function as a <em>gateway</em>, either allowing the request
                to continue or not as it deems fit.
            </p>
            <p>
                By passing what the various middleware objects are doing (I haven't looked at them
                in detail, I'm interested in the view processing here), lets continue. Finally,
                after all the middlewares have processed the request and found nothing 
                illegal/dangerous the last part of the chain <code>_get_response()</code> is called.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is now that a <code>resolver</code> is created. This is what compares the HTTP
                request URL with all of the configured <code>urlpatterns</code>. Once a match is 
                found a match object continaing a callback, the callback's arguments and keyword
                arguments is returned. The callback is in fact the view associated with the <code>url(...)</code>
                that the URL matched the HTTP request URL. So, if it was a FBV then it is a function 
                and if it is a CBV it is a class object that is callable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every middleware object in the <code>_view_middleware</code> list mentioned earlier
                is now called in order and passed the url-match callback and arguments. The first
                one to return an <code>HTTPResonse</code> object &quot;wins&quot; - that is the reponse
                that will be used and no views will be called.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assuming non of the middleware caused a fuss, our view will now be called. For a
                FBV this is easy enough to see how - it just calls the function we wrote. For a CBV,
                however, we generall don't implement any specific entry point for our class. To understand
                how, then, our class is called we must remember we passed it to the <code>url</code>
                function using <code>ourClass.as_view()</code>. The function <code>as_view()</code>
                is part of the <code>django.views.generic.base.View</code>. It is a Django class method so
                can only be called on the class definition and not on a class instance. It
                wraps the class inside a closure that returns a function that accepts the HTTPRequest
                object and arguments. It is this function that encloses and instance of the view class
                that is then called via its <CODE>dispatch()</CODE> with the <code>WSGIRequest</code>
                object as its first parameter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>dispatch()</code> method is quite simple &quot;router&quot; that takes
                the HTTP request method, converts it to lower case, and then tries to call that method
                on the class. Therefore if it was a GET request, it will call the view's <code>get()</code>
                method. If it was a POST request it calls the view's <code>post()</code> method and
                so on...
            </p>
