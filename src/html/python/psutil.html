<h2>Find Out Which Process Has Locked A File</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil" target="_blank">PsUtil</a> is
		<q>...a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes 
			and system utilization...</q>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wanted to know how to find out if a file was alread open in Excel as
		I thought it would be nice to give an informative error message to my
		application's user if the file was locked whilst the app was trying to
		write it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Found the answer in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11114492/check-if-a-file-is-not-open-not-used-by-other-process-in-python"
			target="_blank">this SO thread</a> and the code below is basically
		just a copy of the answer with a couple of adjustments. I found to 
		compare the file names correctly I had to use <tt>os.path.normcase()</tt>
		(on Windows at least) and I had to change <tt>get_open_files()</tt> to 
		<tt>open_files()</tt>. Also added an extra exception handler to handle
		access-denied issues.
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-python">def IsFileAvailableToWrite(filename):
   filename = os.path.normcase(os.path.abspath(filename))
   for proc in psutil.process_iter():
      try:
         for nt in proc.open_files():
            if os.path.normcase(os.path.abspath(nt.path)) == filename:
               return (proc.pid, proc.name())
      except psutil.NoSuchProcess as e:
         # Catches race condition where a proc ends b4 we can examine its files
         pass
      except psutil.AccessDenied as e:
         # If we're not root/admin sometimes we can't query processes
         pass
   return (None, None)</pre>
	<p>
		The to figure out if the write failed I catch the <tt>IOError</tt> 
		exception as follows:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-python">retry = True
while retry:
   try:
      ## YOUR FILE WRITE HERE ##
      pandas_dataframe_obj.to_csv(myFile, ...)
      retry = False
   except IOError as e:
      if e.errno != errno.EACCES: # Only catch access denied errors
         raise
      else:
         pid, pname = IsMapAvailableToWrite(myFile)
         if pid is not None:
            ## Found the process that has this file open ##
            print "The file is already in use. Owned by '{}'".format(pname)
            result = GetUserInput("Have you closed the program?", "yn")
            if result != UserInput.YES:
               raise
         else:
            raise</pre>
