## DSDM (AgilePM) Website
The following notes are all based on **[The DSDM Agile Project Framework website resources](https://www.agilebusiness.org/page/TheDSDMAgileProjectFramework)**.

## High Level Overview

### RAD - Rapid App development 
  * NOT formaly specified
  * IS discussions, demos, short feedback loops
  * BUT supportablity and scalability poor - disciplines of analysis and design 
    weak and not up-front. Not big picture.

### DSDM
  * Created 1994
  * Addresses problems of waterfall and RAD
  * "Mature agile"
  * Vendor-independent approach
  * Assumes 80% of solution value can be delivered for 20% of the effort that it would take to 
    produce the total solution.
  * Approach encourages detail to emerge over time

### Agile Manifesto
Agile - Term first used 2001 - [The Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) reads as follows:

  * INDIVIDUALS AND INTERACTIONS over process and tools.
  * WORKING SOFTWARE (SOLUTION) over comprehensive documentation.
      * Break the illusion of security and stability that comes from document driven
        processes.
      * Only need for high-level versions of these artefacts in early phases.
  * CUSTOMER COLLABORATION over contract negotiation.
      * Encourages project teams and the sponsoring business to work collaboratively
        at all times. Contracts need to reflect this.
      * Contracts are  'light touch' and 'guiding' rather than being 'detailed' and
	'prescriptive'.
  * RESPONDING TO CHANGE over following a plan.

Context:

> ...while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
> on the left more...

It is important not to ignore processes, tools, documentation, contracts and plans but instead
to ensure that they are only created where they add value, and only to the level of detail that
adds value.

### Traditional Project Problems

Problem | Solution DSDM Offers
------- | --------------------
Ineffective communication | Poor comms means high risk of fail. DSDM emphasises *human* interaction over for e.g. emails. Use workshops, daily standups, visual techniques (modelling, prototyping).
Late delivery | Focus on delivery on time - revise scope of delivery ahead of extending deadline.
Does not meet business needs | Includes business representatives as part of SDT (solution dev team).
Wrong thing built | Enables change through iterative development.
Unused features | Keep business priorites at core and using PRL only produce whats wanted.
Delayed / Late ROI | Incremental deliver to do most important features first.
Over-engineering | Avoid diminishing returns by producing "must haves" first "should/could haves" second/third.
"Fragile" agile | Place agile concepts in structured/controlled framework.
Pseudo agile | Only do just enough work upfront to ensure clarify and provide foundation. Avoid waterfall in disguise.

## Philosophy & Fundamentals

The DSDM philosophy is that
> best business value emerges when projects are aligned to clear business
> goals, deliver frequently and involve the collaboration of motivated and
> empowered people

### Composition of DSDM
1. Common sense: sound practical judgment independent of specialised knowledge or training; normal native intelligence.
2. Pragmatism: action or policy dictated by consideration of the immediate practical consequences rather than by theory or dogma.
3. [Process](#dsdm-process)
4. [People](#dsdm-roles)
5. [Products](#dsdm-products)
6. [Practices](#instrumental-success-factors)
7. [Principles](#8-dsdm-principles)
8. Philosophy

### Project Variables
Traditional:

  * Fix Features & quality.
  * Negotiation on time and/or cost.

DSDM:

  * Fix Time, cost, & quality.
  * Negotiate on features.
    * On time and within budget but solution scope is variable. 
  * Uses MoSCoW and timeboxing.
    * Delivers MUST - **M**inimum **U**sable **S**ubse**T** for worst case scenario.
  * Right product, right time.

![DSDM v.s. Waterfall: What can be negotiated on](##IMG_DIR##/dsdm_vs_waterfall_what_can_be_negotiated.jpg)

## 8 DSDM Principles
1. Focus on the business need.
     * Understand business priorities,
     * Create business case,
     * Ensure continuous business sponsorship/collaboration,
     * MUST via MoSCoW.
2. Deliver on time.
     * Timebox,
     * Focus on business priorities,
     * Hit deadlines,
     * Confidence through predictable delivery .
3. Collaborate.
     * Right stakeholders at right time,
     * Encourage pro-active business involvement,
     * Empower all team members on behalf of people they represent,
     * One team culture.
4. Quality is never compromised.
     * Agree quality level before development starts,
     * Ensure quality not variable,
     * Test early, continuously at appropriate level.
     * Constant review
     * Design and doc appropriately
5. Incremental build from firm foundations.
     * EDUF - **E**nough **D**esign **U**p **F**ront.
     * Reassess priorities and viability at every increment.
6. Iterative development.
     * Build business feedback into every increment.
7. Communicate continuously and clearly.
     * Informal face to face conversations
     * Daily standup
     * Workshops + facilitator
     * Visual communication: modelling/prototyping
     * Demo solution early and often
     * Document lean and tidy
     * Manage expectations at all levels
     * Honest and transparent comms
8. Control demonstrated all the time.
     * Plans visible to all
     * Meausure progress by deliverables not completed activity
     * Procative management
     * Evaluate viability based on business objectives continually
     * Approriate level of formality for tracking and reporting

**Memory peg:** 
* **I2C3** - **i**ncremental build, **i**terative dev, **c**ommunicate continuously, **c**ontrol demonstrated, **c**ollaborate.
* **BTQ**  - **b**usiness need, **t**imely delivery, **q**uality never compromised.


## Instrumental Success Factors
1. Embrace the DSDM approach,
     * Incompatible values increase risk of failure and should be addressed.
2. Effective SDT,
     * People at heart of successfull project
     * 4 team elements
         * Empowerment: Each role empowered to make descisions based on their expertise and team as a whole empowered within agreed boundaries.
                        E.g. BA should be empowered to make day-to-day decisions wihout referal to higher authorities.
                        **Manage by exception**.
         * Stability: Don't swap in/out team members over iterations.
         * Skills: Technical but also good "soft skills" like communication.
         * Size: Optimal is 7 +/- 2 people. At this size comms can be done with minimum formality, overhead, rish and maximum benifit/ownership.
3. Business engagement - active and ongoing,
     * Commitment of business time throughout
     * Active Involvement of the business roles
     * Supportive commercial (e.g. contractual) relationship (where appropriate)
5. Interative development, integrated testing and incremental deliver,
6. Transparency
     * Build confidence in *evolving solution*. 
7. PAQ - **P**roject **A**proach **Q**uestionnaire - assessing options and risks. The questions include:
     * All members of the project understand and accept the DSDM approach (Philosophy, Principles and Practices)
     * The Business Sponsor and the Business Visionary demonstrate clear and proactive ownership of the project.
     * The business vision driving the project is clearly stated and understood by all members of the project team
     * All project participants understand and accept that on-time delivery of an acceptable solution is the primary measure of success for the project
     * The requirements can be prioritised and there is confidence that cost and time commitments can be met by flexing the scope of what's delivered.
     * All members of the project team accept that requirements should only be defined at a high level in the early phases of the project and that detail will emerge as development progresses.
     * All members of the project team accept that change in requirements is inevitable and that it is only by embracing change that the right solution will be delivered.
     * The Business Sponsor and Business Visionary understand that active business involvement is essential and have the willingness and authority to commit appropriate business resources to the project.
     * It is possible for the business and solution development members of the Solution Development Team to work collaboratively throughout the project.
     * Empowerment of all members of the Solution Development Teaam is appropriate and sufficient to support the day-to-day decision-making needed to rapidly evolve the solution in short, focussed Timeboxes
     * The DSDM roles and responsibilities are appropriately allocated and all role holders understand and accept the responsibilities associated with their role.
     * The Solution Development team has the appropriate collective knowledge and skills (soft skills and technical skills) to collaboratively evolve an optimal business solution.
     * Solution Development Team members are allocated to the project at an appropriate and consistent level sufficient to fully support the DSDM timeboxing practice
     * Tools and collaborative working practices within the Solution Development Team are sufficient to allow effective Iterative Development of the solution.
     * All necessary review and testing activity is fully integrated within the Iterative Development practice.
     * Project progress is measured primarily through the incremental, demonstrable delivery of business value.
     * There are no mandatory standards or other constraints in place that will prevent the application of the DSDM Philosophy and Practices on this project.

## DSDM Process

There are 6 main lifecyle phases:

![DSDM Lifecycle phases](##IMG_DIR##/dsdm_lifecyle_phases.jpeg)

1. Pre-Project.
      * Ensure only right projects started.
      * Setup up correctly.
      * Based on clearly defined objective - high level definition and over-arching business driver defined + top-level objectives.
      * **Milestone Output**: Terms of reference 
2. Feasibility.
      * Estiblish if project success likely - technical & cost-effective (business) perspectives.
      * Just enough effort to decide if foundations phase is justified.
      * **Milestone Output**: Feasibility assesment.
      * **Evolving Outputs**: Business case, PRL, SAD, DAD, Delivery plan, MMAD
3. Foundations.
      * Preliminary investigation: fundamental, *not detailed*, undestanding of business need.
      * High-level business solution proposition.
      * How development and delivery will be managed.
      * *Avoid* low-level detail - avoid contraining evolutionary phase!
      * **Milestone Output**: Foundations summary.
      * **Evolving Outputs**: Business case, PRL, SAD, DAD, Delivery plan, MMAD
4. Evolutionary Development.
      * Built on firm foundations - evolve/grow the solution - converge over time.
      * Apply iterative development, MoSCoW prioritisation, use modelling and facilitated workshops.
      * Timebox: explore low-level detail & deliver on time.
      * Feedback and demos to ensure right solution meets business needs.
      * **Milestone Output**: Timebox review record.
      * **Evolving Outputs**: Business case, PRL, SAD, DAD, Delivery plan, MMAD
5. Deployment.
      1. Assemble.
           * Make sure deliverable is coherent. E.g. gather supporting information. 
      1. Review.
           *  Approval to deploy.
           *  SDT does *retrospective* for incrment.
           *  Retrospective + formal feview feedback into *project review report* to help guide next increment.
      2. Deploy.
           * Solution deployed into *active* use.
           * **Milestone Output**: Project review report.
6. Post-Project.
      * Checks how well the expected business benefits have been met
          * Immediate and over a pre-defined period of live use.
      * **Milestone Output**: Benefits assesment.


The lifecycle phases are split into business (red), technical (green) and management (blue) and produce products that document
each stage and can be either milestones or evolving in nature:

![DSDM Lifecycle and products](##IMG_DIR##/dsdm_processes_and_products.jpeg)



## DSDM Roles

* Self-organising, empowered teams that:
    * Respect each other's knowledge, experience, skills and opinions,
    * Take personal responsibility,
    * Have courage to challenge & improve ways of working & collaborating.
* Role not necessarily one person.

![DSDM roles](##IMG_DIR##/dsdm_roles.jpeg)

### Business Sponsor (BS)

* Interpret needs of BS and communicate these to team - ensure represented in business case
* Ensures:
    * Solution enables benifits described in business case
* Owns:
    * Deployed solution abd realisation of benifits

    * Technical risks.
    * SAD - Software Architecture Definition.
* Responsibilities:
    * Agree/control technical architecture.
    * Determine technical architecture.
    * With BA, turn business requirements into technical solution.
    * Empower techincal roles.
    * Final arbter of technical differences between SDT members.

### Project Manager (PM)

     * Not intermidiary - business roles need to be fully involved themselves!
  
### Team Leader (TL)
* Servant-leader:
    * Shares power, puts needs of employees 1st, helps people develop/perform as highly as possible.
    * Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists to serve the people.

* Reponsible: organise and facilitator sessions.
    * Agree scope, plan, engage, review, distribut results.
* Independent of desired workshop outcome.
  
### DSDM Coach (DC)
* Providing detailed knowledge and experience of DSDM
* Good for team that has limited experience of using DSDM

![Who produces, approves and uses Business Case](##IMG_DIR##/dsdm_business_case_people_involved.jpeg)

### Prioritised Requirements List (PRL)
* Evolutionary
* High level requirements
* High level in feasability: 1 - 10 requirements
* User stores in foundations: 10 - 100 stories
    * Baseline in foundations *demarcates scope of project*.
* Tasks in evolutionary development: may be 1000s.
* Detail (depth) emerges over time
* Scope changes (breadth), i.e. add/remove/change high level requirements needs *formal control*!
*
