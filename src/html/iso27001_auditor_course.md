> Whether you like it or not, every business is a target for cyber attackers, and that includes yours.
>
> Data breaches are becoming more severe, yet many organisations still assume they will never suffer one.
>
> However, you should adopt a "when not if" mentality if you want to protect your business.
>
> Effective defences can prevent the majority of attacks and help you to prepare for a breach.
>
> Robust cyber security requires an ISMS (information security management system) built on three pillars: people, processes and technology.
> ...
> An ISMS is a systematic approach consisting of processes, technology and people that helps you protect and manage your organisation's information through effective risk management.
>
> It enables compliance with many laws, including the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)


> an ISMS ensures transparency, repeatable processes and measurable KPIs.
> Put simply, a well-implemented ISMS means there are no more information security surprises lurking around the
> corner
> ...
> ISMS follows a top-down strategy. Management can delegate tasks related to implementation, but not the responsibility itself
> ...
>  the goal of an ISMS is not to ensure maximum information security. Instead, an ISMS allows an organisation to achieve their desired level of information security. The decisive factor here is the organisation's appetite for risk
> ...
> an ISMS will increase the value of organisations because without one, companies don’t have a clear overview of their own processes and information assets.

      * Process serves a specific objective/outcome.
      * Ingredients:
        * Input
        * Activity to convert input to...
        * Output (product/objective/deliverable etc). Objective could be a product, service etc etc.
      * Questions: Who is doing the process, what is the process, why are they doing it, how, where, when? These questions make it a process centric approach. Who's responsible for the delivery of the objectives etc etc can be extra questions.
          * WHO

* 10 clauses (1-3 missing because they are boiler-plate intro sections of the doc):
  1. [Context of the Organisation](https://advisera.com/27001academy/knowledgebase/how-to-define-context-of-the-organization-according-to-iso-27001/)
     * Understanding context involves understanding external and internal issues that affect ability to achieve ISMS outcomes.
     * Recognition of components relating to business puposes and accomplishing ISMS aims.
     * Context - both internal & external shapes the context of the organisation
         * External : factors an organization has no control over, but that it can anticipate and adapt to
             * GDPR regulations
             * Government etc
             * Industry regulators
         * Internal : factors under the direct control of the organization
             * Sponsors etc
             * Organizational structure. Knowing the roles, accountabilities, and hierarchy in the organization
             * Available resources. Knowing what equipment, technologies, systems, capital, time, personnel, and knowledge you already have in your organization
             * Contractual relationships. Understanding the relationships with suppliers and customers can allow an organization to include, in the scope of its ISMS, controls needed to better manage the customers and suppliers’ requirements.
         * Intrested parties
             * Needs and expectiations - evaluation of interested parties, their requirements, and contractual responsibilities.
             * > An interested party is essentially a stakeholder – an individual or a group of people affected by your organisation’s activities.
               > In the context of ISO 27001, their interest regards your ISMS (information security management system) and your ability to prevent data breaches.
             * Could include employees, shareholders, regulators/governments, suppliers and partners, customers, the media...
       * Scope of ISMS - should be determined by consideration of interested parties' requirements, internal and external problems and existing processes. Needs within the context - the input/process/output of the organisation. What processes do you want to cover as an ISO270001 certified company - the information sensitive stuff to cover!!
         * Scope == the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant.
         * Only organisations can be certified. So if a product buyer needs you certified it is the org that is certified, not the product.
         * E.g. canNOT put cert logo on your products as it is a certification of a whole business managemnent system/process, not the product.
           * The proceedure/system will ensure the trucks are MOT'd the drivers are trained, health checks done etc... i.e. the ISMS proceedures/system are about *how* you certify your products.
           * The company can be certified, not the product so if you want the logo say your *company* is certified and not the product.
         * [How to...](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-document-the-scope-of-your-isms)
         * > There are three steps to defining the scope of your ISMS. First, you need to identify every location where information is stored. This includes physical and digital files, the latter of which might be kept locally or in the Cloud. Second, you need to identify how information can be accessed. Any entry point, be it a drawer full of files or an employee’s work-issued laptop, should be noted.
         * DOC: Information Security Context, Requirements and Scope.
              1. Organisational context
                 1. Activities
                    1. Describes what the organisation does, when it was formed, the services/products is provides, its structure (e.g. a group of companies), industrial sectors, main customers, geographical regions where it operates, turnover etc.
                 2. Functions
                    1. Sales & marketing, Finance & accounting, HR, operations, logistics, PMO, risk and compliance, IT, governance etc

                    1. As above
                 5. Major Partnerships
                 6. Supply Chains
                    1. If loads and loads of chains dont need to describe all - use a risk based assesment
                    2. Describe products/services affected, links in the chain, how well established chain is
                 7. Interfaces and dependencies with other organisations
                    1. E.g. who does company outsource activities like IT to?
                 8. Business objectives and policies  
                    1. THe purpose of the ISMS is to ensure that org is still able to meets its business objectives in the face of potential and actual security incidents. Set out objectives to establish clear relationship with with objective of ISMS.
              2. External and internal issues
                 1. Internal
                    1. E.g. uncertainties in employee relations, significant org changes, location omves, company financial performance, company culture, resources and knowledge in the org, governance and org structure, adopted standards and models, contractual relationships.

                 3. Risk appetite
                    1. ISMS is designed to address major risks identified to infosec of org. The level of risk appetite will influence risk assesments.
              3. Interested parties and their requirements
                 1. E.g., Shareholders, directors, suppliers, customers, regulatory bodies, employees, contractors, governments, trade associations / industry bodies, trade unions, investors, competitors, media, dependents of employees etc,,,
                 2. For each party list name, nature, degree of influence over org, value of interest
                 3. COnsider all applicable regulatory requirements
                 4. Eg for a shareholder the requirement summary could be "value of share price to be maintained".
              4. Pupose and scope of ISMS
                 1. Pupose
                    1. the purpose of the ISMS is to
                       1. Understand the orgs needs and the necessity for establishing the ISMS policy and objectives
                       2. Implement and operate controls and measures for managing the org's overall capability to manage informations ecurity incidents
                       3. Monitor and review the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS
                       4. COntinuall improve the orgs info security based on objective measurement.
                 2. Potential impact of an information security incident
                    1. Loss of revenue
                    2. Risk to life on health and safety grounds
                    3. Loss of reputation/customer confidence
                    4. Inability to meet legal obligations
                    5. Breach of contractual obligations
                    6. Breach of legal requirements
                    7. Loss of business opportunitiy
                    8. Fines/penalites etc
                 3. Information security objectives
                    1. Could be "comply with health and sagey legislation at all times", "protect client secrets". "minimise loss of revenue" etc.
                 4. Scope of the ISMS
                    1. Organisational
                    2. Products and services
                    3. Activities
                    4. Exclusions

Third, you need to determine what is out of scope. These are elements that your organisation either has no control over (such as third-party products) or that don’t give access to or house sensitive information.
  1. Leadership
     * Senior management have role of gaining sopport of ISMS withint eh org and ensure they coop with the workings of the ISM, e.g. understanding its significance and provision of required resources.
     * Policy - management must align ISMS with organisational purposes and objectives. The policy must be documented, transmitted throughout the organisation, and accessibhle to interested parties.
     * Roles, responsibilities and authorities - must be communicated properly.
  2. Planning
     * Plan risk management, opportunities exploitation etc
       * [Risk assessment and treatment defn](https://advisera.com/27001academy/iso-27001-risk-assessment-treatment-management/#section3)
       * ISO 27001:2013 requirements are not very difficult – here is what clause 6.1.2 requires:
            1. Define how to identify the risks that could cause the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of your information.
            2. Define how to identify the risk owners.
            3. Define the criteria for assessing consequences and assessing the likelihood of the risk.
            4. Define how the risk will be calculated.
            5. Define the criteria for accepting risks.
       * [A good threat/vulnerability list](https://advisera.com/27001academy/knowledgebase/threats-vulnerabilities/) 
     * General: Construct plans for preventive action, so that the ISMS can achieve its goals
     * Information Security Risk Assessment: Orgs must make plans for the procedure of info secutiy risk assessments that invovle risk identification, analysis and evaluation.
     * Info security risk treatment: define a process for the treatment of info security risks.
  3. Support
     * Not just the infrastructure but also the people's competance and awareness.
  4. Operation
     * Org needs to enforce the info security rish treatment plan and retain documented info on the outcomes of that risk treatment.
       * Ensure the reisk treatment process decribed in 6.1 occurs.
       * **Risk treatment plan** - brainstorm scenarios and put some kind of (realistic) mitigation in place.
  5.  Performance Evalulation
  6.  Improvement
     *  Nonconformity and corrective action, continual improvement

* Certification needs to be renewed every 3 years. Re-cert audit at the end of 3 years. Every year there is a surveillance audit.

* [What is an interested party](https://advisera.com/27001academy/knowledgebase/how-to-identify-interested-parties-according-to-iso-27001-and-iso-22301/?utm_source=clause-by-clause-explanation-of-iso-27001&utm_medium=downloaded-content&utm_content=lang-en&utm_campaign=free-knowledgebase-27001
  > An interested party is a stakeholder, i.e., a person or organization that can influence your information security/business continuity, or a person or organization that can be affected by your information security or business continuity activities. It could be employees, employee families, shareholders/owners of the business, government agencies/regulators, emergency services, clients, media, suppliers, and partners.
  > How can you identify them? Just ask your top executives, as well as heads of departments about who is important for their business, and then assess whether they could be interested in your information security or business continuity. 
  > you need to know what all the interested parties want from you, and you need to figure out how to satisfy all these requirements in your ISMS / BCMS.
  > For example, shareholders want the security of investment and a good return, clients want you to comply with security clauses in the contracts you signed with them, government agencies want you to comply with information security/business continuity laws and regulations, the media want quick and accurate news related to your incidents, etc. However, you have to be more specific than this – you have to specify exactly which laws and regulations, which security or continuity clauses exist in the contracts, and so on.

* [Scope](https://advisera.com/27001academy/knowledgebase/how-to-define-the-isms-scope/?utm_source=clause-by-clause-explanation-of-iso-27001&utm_medium=downloaded-content&utm_content=lang-en&utm_campaign=free-knowledgebase-27001)
   > The main purpose of setting the ISMS (information security management system) scope is to define which information you intend to protect ... you will be responsible for protecting this information no matter where, how, and by whom this information is accessed ... So, for example, if you have laptops that your employees carry out of your office, this doesn’t mean these laptops are outside of your scope – they should be included in your scope if through these laptops the employees can access your local network and all the sensitive information and services located there.

* What is an ISMS
  * Application of 270001
  * Set of policies and proceedures for management of sensitive data and related systems on a veriety of levels.
  * Guidelines for documentation, auditing, continual improvement, and corrective and preventive action,
  * The overarchign goal is to ensure CIA
  * Implementation of clauses validated through internal audit.
  * ISMS incorporates continuous feedback anbd improvement - Plan Do Check Act - PDCA
  * Address changes over time such as threads, vulnerabilities and their impacts.
  * Focus:
    * Business processes and assets
    * Reduicing risk to data assets and related systems
  * Goals: Minimise risk ----> Ensure info security ---> Proactively limit the impact of security breaches

* CIA
  * Confidentiality
    * Protecting info from unotherorized access/paries
    * Measures that seek to protect the confidentiality of information include:
        * Encryption of data
        * User access control
        * Physical and environmental security
        * Operational security
        * Communications security
  * Integrity
    * Protect info from modification my unautorized users
    * Measures that seek to protect the integrity of information include:
        * User access control
        * Asset management
        * System acquisition, development, and maintenance 
  * Availability
    * Making the info available to authorised users.
    * Measures that seek to protect the availability of information include:
        * Risk analysis
        * System acquisition, development, and maintenance
        * Incident management
        * Business continuity management 
  * Extensions:
      * Non-redudiation
      * Accountability
          * If data is changed, the objectives of non-repudiation and accountability make it possible to attribute the changes in question to one single, indisputable identity
      * Authenticity

* Key components
  * Policy then proceedures/process, technology to help it and user behaviour.
  * Main objectiv e of ISMS is to implement the appropriate measures in order to eliminate or minimse the impac that various information security related threads and vulnerabilities might have on an organisation.
    * Availability of services ---> Preservation of data confidentiality ---> Integrity
  * Plan:
    * Documentation
    * Implementation


* Project Plan
  * Documentation
  * 133 security measures, ogranised into 39 control objectives, and 11 sections. Sections define best practices for:
    * Business continuity planning
    * System acquisition, development and maintenance
    * Information security incident management
    * Communication and oepratiosn mangement
    * Physical and environmental security
  * Decision Making
    * How and when to implement standard influence by
      * Existing IT maturity levels
      * Customer requirements
      * Existing training programs
      * Business objectives and priorities
* Phases of Implementation
  1. Identify Business Objectives
  2. Obtain Management Support
  3. Select the Proper Scope of Implementation
  4. Define a Method of Risk Assessment
  5. Prepare an Inventory of Information Assets to Protect, and Rank Assets Accoring to Risk Classification Based on Risk Assessment
  6. Mange the Risks, and Create a Risk Treatment Plan
  7. Setup Policies and Procedures to Control Risks.


* 6 steps:
  1. Definition of security policy
     1. Output = Policy Document
  2. Definition is ISMS scope
     1. Output = Scope of ISMS
  3. Risk assessment
     1. Input examples = threats, impacts, vulnerabilities, risk management strategy, additional controls
     2. Output = List of assessed risks, identified weakness for assets
  4. Risk management
  5. Selection of approriate controls
  6. Statement of applicability
  

Process: a group of repeatable and interrelated activities performed to transform a series of inputs into
defined outputs.

Process approach: management of a group of processes together as a system, where the interrelations
between processes are identified and the outputs of a previous process are treated as the inputs of the
following one. This approach helps ensure the results of each individual process will add business value
and contribute to achieve the final desired results.

Phase 1 - scope design build --> phase 2 - first cycle of implementation ----> BAU monitor operate improve

E.g. cloud provider - scope is that org offers cloud based data storage services to all energy based industruct clients << This is a scope!



* 27005 - information security risk management guideline set. Can be for an org or a descrete unit within, e.g. a dept.



## Introduction To Auditing
* **Statement of Pupose**
* Reporting Relationships
    * Who we are talking with and how we faciliate that relationship.
    * How are we recording the information.
* Programme Activities - how program has been shaped up and how it works within the company
* Roles and Responsibilities
* Points of Contact - We are we speaking too as an auditee
* Reporting Requirements

```
Develop   ---> Create ---> Select tools ---> Manage, train ---> Conduct ---> Produce findings ---> Assess + improve
Strategy       Audit       & protocols       & assign           audits       and reports           programme quality.
               Plans                         auditors
```

* Standards such as Generall Accepted Auiting Standards **GAAS**

* Information System Audit
    * General controls review 
    * System controls
        * How did we develop the system? how can we review it and see that it is delivering what we want?


Principles of auditing
1. planning
   1. Take into account system as well as internal control procedures.
2. honesty
3. impartiality
4. secrecy
   1. do not disclose audit information!
5. consistency
   1. Follow same processes in future years. The process of auditing should be standard - consistent between audits.
6. legal framework
   1. rule of law must be applied
7. internal controls
   1. Ensure evidence exists of control use
8. report



Techniques
1. examinatin of record
   1. can see what was done.
2. inquiry
3. sampling
4. confirmation
   1. auditor collects information from stakeholds and confirmation is response to an enquiry to proce certain data recorded.
5. analytical review


Have to accept the face value of the statements made by the auditee. If you suspect and want to see the evidence, 
then you can ask the question and ask them to share the evidence with you.

Criticality of report?
Criticality of controls bespoke to the company.
What value to those controls offer? E.g. access controls.
    how do they manage access control to their data, encryption at rest, at transit etc etc.


Phases:
1. Preparation and planning
2. Execution & fieldwork - go on site and do audit
3. Recording and reporting - record evidence, make notes
4. Follow up assessment.


## Perfoming ISO audits
* Peparing audit
    * How do we ensure the audit is actually completed?
    * Scope should be broken down in the ISMS plan/checklist
    * Include timings and priorities - the plan/agenda
    * Negotiate resourcing


ADOPTING - can do it piecmeal - start with a small section - auditing one little thing and growing from there.

Mandatory documents for ISO 27001 compliance Chloe Biscoe  8th July 2019
Organisations that implement ISO 27001 must demonstrate their compliance by completing appropriate documents.

## ISO 27001’s mandatory documents include:
[Ref](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/documentation-required-by-iso-27001-2)
* 4.3 The scope of the ISMS
* 5.2 Information security policy
* 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment process
    * Risks are identified to to CIA of information within the scope of the ISMS.
      * Compile & maintain asset list
      * Identify potential threats for each asset (group)
      * Assess the impact and the liklihood. 
      * Evaluate risk - i.e. determine whether to accept, mitigate, remove, transfer (share).
* 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment plan
    *  Risk Assessment and Treatment process
    *  Not required by ISO27001, but can be useful - ISO31000 gives "official" view of how risk management should be carried out.

RACI Matrix
* A RACI chart informs the organization about its employees’ workload, as it shows which functional role(s) are assigned to each person.
* Responsible: The person who does the work to achieve the task. As a rule, this is one person; examples might be a business analyst, application developer or technical architect. They have responsibility for getting the work done or decisions made.
* Accountable: The person who is responsible for the correct and thorough completion of the task. This role must be one person and is often the project executive or project sponsor. This role is in the role that responsible is accountable to and approves their work.
* Consulted: The people who provide information for the project and with whom there is two-way communication. This role is usually several people, often subject matter experts.
* Informed: The people kept informed of progress and with whom there is one-way communication. These are people affected by the outcome of the tasks, so they need to be kept up to date.
