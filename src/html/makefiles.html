<h2>Makefile Basics</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		A Makefile describes how your program is built by specifying everything
		that it depends on and building the dependencies first. A Makefile rule
		looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">target_1 ... target_n: prerequisite_1 ... prerequisite_m
&lt;tab&gt;   command_1   # NOTE that each command
&lt;tab&gt;   ...         # is executed in its own
&lt;tab&gt;   command_j   # subshell.
</pre>
	<p>Here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Target</b> is anything the must be made.</li>
		<li><b>Prerequisite</b> are things that must be built before the target can be built.</li>
		<li><b>Commands</b> are shell commands used to build the target. NOTE, each command executed in own subshell!</li>
		<li><b>Rule</b> is what's shown above - it defines how to build a target.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To perform a build, make will construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the rules. It will
		then do a post order traversal (visit children first), building the leaf nodes first and
		going back up the graph.
	</p>
	<p>
		A very simple example is shown below:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="##IMG_DIR##/makefile_dag.png" alt="A Makefile DAG diagram"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		The makefile for the above diagram would look something like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">target: prequisite_1 prequisite_1 prequisite_1
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_A

prequisite_1: prequisite_4
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_B

prequisite_2: prequisite_5
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_C

prequisite_3: prequisite_5 prequisite_7
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_D

prequisite_4:
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_E

prequisite_5: prequisite_6
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_F

prequisite_6:
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_G

prequisite_7:
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_H</pre>
	<p>
		The post-order traversal is shown by the orange-background numbers.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make looks at <code>target</code> and visits the first child, <code>prerequisit_1</code>. It can
			see that <code>prerequisit_1</code> depends on <code>prerequisit_4</code>. So now, <code>prerequisit_1</code>
			becomes the &quot;target&quot;. If make determines that <code>prerequisit_1</code>
			is newer than <code>prerequisit_4</code>, it will build <code>prerequisit_4</code>. We assume
			that it does and builds <code>prerequisit_4</code> using <code>commands_E</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once <code>prerequisit_4</code> is built, all of <code>prerequisit_1</code>'s dependencies
			have been visited so <code>prerequisit_1</code> can now be built using <code>commands_B</code>.
		</li>
		<li>Make returns back to <code>target</code> and examines the next dependency,
			<code>prerequisit_2</code>. Assuming <code>prerequisit_5</code> is older than <code>prerequisit_2</code>,
			and <code>prerequisit_6</code> is older than <code>prerequisit_5</code>, the post-order traversal
			will result in make next trying to build <code>prerequisit_6</code> using <code>commands_F</code>.
		</li>
		<li>All of <code>prerequisit_5</code>'s dependencies have been built so make can now
			build <code>prerequisit_5</code> using <code>commands_F</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			All of <code>prerequisit_2</code>'s dependencies have been built so make can now build
			<code>prerequisit_2</code> using <code>commands_C</code>.
		</li>
		<li>Make returns back to <code>target</code> and examines the next dependency <code>prerequisit_3</code>.
			There are two dependencies, <code>prerequisit_5</code> and <code>prerequisit_7</code>.
			Make has already built <code>prerequisit_5</code> so it knows that it does not need
			to build this again, so it ignores this path... nice! Thus all that is left is to
			look at <code>prerequisit_7</code>, assuming it is older than <code>prerequisit_3</code>.
			Assume it is, so make builds it.
		</li>
		<li>
			All of <code>prerequisit_3</code>'s dependencies have been built so it can now
			be built.
		</li>
		<li>Make returns back to <code>target</code> and because all of its dependencies
			have been built, it can finally be built.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		By doing this kind of traversal make ensures that everything that is need to be
		built is built, but not more than this. I.e., if some dependencies do not need to
		be refreshed, they are not rebuilt, helping to produce an efficient build.
	</p>
	<p>
		The basic make process can be described like this:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make finds files indicated by the targets and prerequisites.
		</li>
		<li>If a prerequisite has a rule associated with it (i.e., make is looking at the rule <code>target: prerequisite</code> and the rule <code>prerequisite: dependencies</code> exists), make will try to update the prerequisite first.
		</li>
		<li>When considering a target, if any prerequisite is newer than the target, make will
			attempt to make the prequisite(s) first.
		</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Makefile Automatic Variables</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        This is just a summary of some of the more commonly used automatic variables. You can
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html" target="_blank">find a complete list here</a>.
        The automatic variables do not have very user-friendly names so I have a few memory pegs I try to use to recall what they all mean...
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Variable</td>
                <td>Meaning</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><code>$@</code></td>
                <td>The file name of the target of the rule. Remember a rule looks like <code>target: prerequisites</code>. I like to remember this by thinking of the <code>@</code> symbol as looking like a dart board or some kind of target. If the rule has multiple target <code>$@</code> refers to whatever target caused the rule to be run.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><code>$&lt;</code></td>
                <td>The name of the first prerequisite. Memory peg: The chevron looks like it &quot;points&quot; to a target, so think prerequisite.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><code>$?</code></td>
                <td>The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target. Memory peg: It's a question... what prerequisite is newer?</td>

            <tr>
                <td><code>$^</code></td>

<h2>Makefile Pattern Rules</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        In the example makefile in the introduction section, each target was explicitly written
        down. This would be fine for a small project, but if you have more than
        a few source files, listing each one independently will soon get tedious and error prone.
        Most of the time we just want to say &quot;and object file is generated from a c/c++ source
        file with the same file base name&quot;. And luckily we can... to say this we would
        write something like the following.
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">%.o: %.cpp
&lt;tab&gt;   ...Commands...

my-target: fileA.o fileB.o ... fileZ.o</pre>
    <p>
        In the above example, Make knows that to build <code>my-target</code> it must build the
        object files <code>fileA.o</code> through <code>fileZ.o</code>. So, how does it construct
        these objects? It looks through all of the rules it has encountered so far and tries to
        match each <code>file?.o</code> with a target. It finds <code>%.o</code>, where <code>%</code>
        is a <em>wild card</em>. The <code>%</code> matches the portion <code>file?</code> of the
        prerequisite (this portion is called the <em>stem</em>), so Make can use this rule to 
        construct the object file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets take <code>fileA.o</code> as an example. Make will search for the file. If the file is
        as new or newer than the target it knows that this prerequisite does not need to be rebuilt.
        However, if it does, Make searches for a rule that will tell it how to build the prerequisite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make finds the rule <code>%.o: %.c; commands</code>: <code>fileA.o</code> matches
        <code>%.o</code>, where the <code>%</code> matches <code>fileA</code>. The prerequisite
        for this rule specified <code>%.c</code>, which substituting in the match will become
        <code>fileA.c</code>. As long as <code>fileA.c</code> is just a file and not generated
        by some other tool, Make will find no rule to create this file, so if the file doesn't
        exist, then Make reports an error, otherwise it will rebuild <code>fileA.c</code> if it
        is newer than the target <code>fileA.o</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If two or more rules match Make will prefer more specific rules over more generic ones.
