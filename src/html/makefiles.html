<h2>Makefile Basics</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		A Makefile describes how your program is built by specifying everything
		that it depends on and building the dependencies first. A Makefile rule
		looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">target_1 ... target_n: prerequisite_1 ... prerequisite_m
&lt;tab&gt;   command_1   # NOTE that each command
&lt;tab&gt;   ...         # is executed in its own
&lt;tab&gt;   command_j   # subshell.
</pre>
	<p>Here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Target</b> is anything the must be made.</li>
		<li><b>Prerequisite</b> are things that must be built before the target can be built.</li>
		<li><b>Commands</b> are shell commands used to build the target. NOTE, each command executed in own subshell!</li>
		<li><b>Rule</b> is what's shown above - it defines how to build a target.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To perform a build, make will construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the rules. It will
		then do a post order traversal (visit children first), building the leaf nodes first and
		going back up the graph.
	</p>
	<p>
		A very simple example is shown below:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="##IMG_DIR##/makefile_dag.png" alt="A Makefile DAG diagram"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		The makefile for the above diagram would look something like this:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">target: prequisite_1 prequisite_1 prequisite_1
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_A

prequisite_1: prequisite_4
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_B

prequisite_2: prequisite_5
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_C

prequisite_3: prequisite_5 prequisite_7
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_D

prequisite_4:
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_E

prequisite_5: prequisite_6
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_F

prequisite_6:
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_G

prequisite_7:
&lt;tab&gt;   commands_H</pre>
	<p>
		The post-order traversal is shown by the orange-background numbers.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Make looks at <code>target</code> and visits the first child, <code>prerequisit_1</code>. It can
			see that <code>prerequisit_1</code> depends on <code>prerequisit_4</code>. So now, <code>prerequisit_1</code>
			becomes the &quot;target&quot;. If make determines that <code>prerequisit_1</code>
			is newer than <code>prerequisit_4</code>, it will build <code>prerequisit_4</code>. We assume
			that it does and builds <code>prerequisit_4</code> using <code>commands_E</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once <code>prerequisit_4</code> is built, all of <code>prerequisit_1</code>'s dependencies
			have been visited so <code>prerequisit_1</code> can now be built using <code>commands_B</code>.
		</li>
		<li>Make returns back to <code>target</code> and examines the next dependency,
			<code>prerequisit_2</code>. Assuming <code>prerequisit_5</code> is older than <code>prerequisit_2</code>,
			and <code>prerequisit_6</code> is older than <code>prerequisit_5</code>, the post-order traversal
			will result in make next trying to build <code>prerequisit_6</code> using <code>commands_F</code>.
		</li>
		<li>All of <code>prerequisit_5</code>'s dependencies have been built so make can now
			build <code>prerequisit_5</code> using <code>commands_F</code>.
		</li>
		<li>
			All of <code>prerequisit_2</code>'s dependencies have been built so make can now build
			<code>prerequisit_2</code> using <code>commands_C</code>.
		</li>
		<li>Make returns back to <code>target</code> and examines the next dependency <code>prerequisit_3</code>.
			There are two dependencies, <code>prerequisit_5</code> and <code>prerequisit_7</code>.
			Make has already built <code>prerequisit_5</code> so it knows that it does not need
			to build this again, so it ignores this path... nice! Thus all that is left is to
			look at <code>prerequisit_7</code>, assuming it is older than <code>prerequisit_3</code>.
			Assume it is, so make builds it.
		</li>
		<li>
			All of <code>prerequisit_3</code>'s dependencies have been built so it can now
			be built.
		</li>
		<li>Make returns back to <code>target</code> and because all of its dependencies
			have been built, it can finally be built.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		By doing this kind of traversal make ensures that everything that is need to be
		built is built, but not more than this. I.e., if some dependencies do not need to
		be refreshed, they are not rebuilt, helping to produce an efficient build. It is also the
		case that targets that are as new as all of their dependencies are not rebuilt.
	</p>
	<p>
		The basic make process can be described like this:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make finds files indicated by the targets and prerequisites.
		</li>
		<li>If a prerequisite has a rule associated with it (i.e., make is looking at the rule <code>target: prerequisite</code> and the rule <code>prerequisite: dependencies</code> exists), make will try to update the prerequisite first.
		</li>
		<li>When considering a target, if any prerequisite is newer than the target, make will
			attempt to make the prequisite(s) first.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>PHONY targets</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			A special type of target is a <em><code>.PHONY</code> target</em>, which is always out of date and
			thus always rebuilt.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>How Make Locates Source Files: <code>VPATH</code> &amp; <code>vpath</code></h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			When a rule references a file without a path Make looks in the <em>current working directory</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Few projects are housed in a single directory. One solution is to use <code>VPATH</code> to instruct
			Make to look in other directories for files.
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">VPATH = dir1 dir2 dir3 ...</pre>
		<p>
			This works for source files, i.e. <code>*.c, *.cpp</code> etc but not includes. For those modifdy <code>CPPFLAGS</code>.
            Only targets and dependencies are searched using <code>VPATH</code>. Paths in commands are not!
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Beware</b> of same-named files in different directories. Make just uses the first one it sees,
			so this can cause problems!
		</p>
        <p>
            The <code>VPATH</code> special variable is course-grained. It applies to all files. To be more <em>specific</em>
            use <code>vpath</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">vpath pattern dir-list</pre>
        <p>
            For example, to search for C files only under the <code>src</code> directory and headers
            only under the <code>include</code> directory one could write the following:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">vpath %.h include
vpath %.c src</pre>
	</div>

    <h3>Make Phases</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Make does its work in two phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Reads Makefile and all included makefiles. Load vars and rules into internal DB. Simple-expanded vars expanded. Create DAG.</li>
            <li>Analyse DAG, recursively-expanded vars expanded, determined targets to update, update include targets first and possibly restart, then execute commands for all other rules.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
    </div>

<h2>Makefile Automatic Variables</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        This is just a summary of some of the more commonly used automatic variables. You can
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html" target="_blank">find a complete list here</a>.
        The automatic variables do not have very user-friendly names so I have a few memory pegs I try to use to recall what they all mean...
    </p>

                <td><code>$^</code></td>
                <td>The names of all the prerequisites (duplicated removed). Memory peg: it's pointing up, so all of the above prerequisite.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
</div> <!-- END: Makefile Automatic Variables -->

<h2>Makefile Pattern Rules</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        In the example makefile in the introduction section, each target was explicitly written
        down. This would be fine for a small project, but if you have more than
        a few source files, listing each one independently will soon get tedious and error prone.
        Most of the time we just want to say &quot;and object file is generated from a c/c++ source
        file with the same file base name&quot;. And luckily we can... to say this we would
        write something like the following.
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">%.o: %.cpp
&lt;tab&gt;   ...Commands...

my-target: fileA.o fileB.o ... fileZ.o</pre>
    <p>
        In the above example, Make knows that to build <code>my-target</code> it must build the
        object files <code>fileA.o</code> through <code>fileZ.o</code>. So, how does it construct
        these objects? It looks through all of the rules it has encountered so far and tries to
        match each <code>file?.o</code> with a target. It finds <code>%.o</code>, where <code>%</code>
        is a <em>wild card</em>. The <code>%</code> matches the portion <code>file?</code> of the
        prerequisite (this portion is called the <em>stem</em>), so Make can use this rule to 
        construct the object file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets take <code>fileA.o</code> as an example. Make will search for the file. If the file is
        as new or newer than the target it knows that this prerequisite does not need to be rebuilt.
        However, if it does, Make searches for a rule that will tell it how to build the prerequisite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make finds the rule <code>%.o: %.c; commands</code>: <code>fileA.o</code> matches
        <code>%.o</code>, where the <code>%</code> matches <code>fileA</code>. The prerequisite
        for this rule specified <code>%.c</code>, which substituting in the match will become
        <code>fileA.c</code>. As long as <code>fileA.c</code> is just a file and not generated
        by some other tool, Make will find no rule to create this file, so if the file doesn't
        exist, then Make reports an error, otherwise it will rebuild <code>fileA.c</code> if it
        is newer than the target <code>fileA.o</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If two or more rules match Make will <em>prefer more specific rules over more generic ones</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Limiting Scope Of Pattern Rules</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            To limit the scope of a pattern rule that includes wild cards to a set of files use the
            following:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">$(OBJECTS) : %.o : %.c</pre>
        <p>
            In the above the <code>%.o</code> will only match object filesnames in the variable
            <code>OBJECTS</code>and thus the pre-requisites will only match the corresponding objects
            from <code>OBJECTS</code>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Implicit Rules</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Make includes a set of default rules for commonly required types of dependencies. For
            example, you will generally not need to tell make how to compile a C or C++ program as
            its default rule database already has this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the default rule database by typing (you can ommit the pipe to vim if you want, but
            the output is many screens long):
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">make -p -q | vim -
      ^  ^
      ^  Don't execute any commands
      Print rule database</pre>
        <p>
            If you search the output for C/C++ rules you will find the following rules, amougst others,
            which are presented here possibly out-of-order wrt to the Make db print out:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">OUTPUT_OPTION = -o $@

LINK.c = $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH)
LINK.o = $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH)

LINK.cpp = $(LINK.cc)
LINK.cc = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH)

COMPILE.cpp = $(COMPILE.cc)
COMPILE.cc = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c
COMPILE.c = $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c

%: %.o
        $(LINK.o) $^ $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS) -o $@

%: %.c
        $(LINK.c) $^ $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS) -o $@

%.o: %.c
        $(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $&lt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        So, if a Makefile has a rule <code>file1.o: file1.c</code>,
        Make will find the rule <code>%.o: %.c</code> and execute the rule <code>$(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $&lt;</code>.
        This expands to <code>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c -o $@ $&lt;</code>, which expands to
        <code>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c -o file1.o file1.c</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what do the variables such as <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>CPPFLAGS</code> expand to? These must be
        set by the makefile creator to meet the needs of their compilation!

<h2>Variables</h2>
<div>
    <h3>Naming conventions</h3>
    <p>
        Constants or environment variables in upper snake case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Variables internam to the make file, lower snake case.
    </p>

    <h3>Types</h3>
    <p>
        Variables are either <em>simple expanded</em> or <em>recursively expanded</em>.
    </p>
    <h4>Simple Expanded</h4>
    <p>Simple expanded variables are declared like so:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">SIMPLE_EXPANDED := some-value
#               ^^
#               Note the colon before the equals!
#               some-value is expanded IMMEDIATELY upon reading this line</pre>
    <p>
        Simple expanded variables have their RHS expression expanded immediately upon being
        encountered, during the 1st make phase, and have the value of the expansion assigned to the variable.
    </p>

    <h4>Recursively Expanded</h4>
    <p>Recursively expanded variables are declared like so: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">RECUSIVE_EXPANDED = some-value
#              ^^
#              Note ONLY the equals!
#              some-value is not expanded. just stored as-is in the variable without evaluating it!</pre>
    <p>
        A recusively expanded variable just has the RHS stored as-is in the variable without any
        evaluation what so ever. The value is only ever expanded when the variable is <em>USED</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>When Expansion Occurs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LHS of variable assignments immediately expanded</li>
        <li>RHS of <code>=</code> and <code>?=</code> expansion deferred until second phase</li>
        <li>RHS of <code>:=</code> immediately expanded</li>
        <li>RHS of <code>+=</code> immediately expanded for variables declared with <code>:=</code>,
        otherwise expansion/evaluation deferred until use</li>
        <li>Rule targets and prerequisites immediately expanded. Commands deferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Target Specific Variables</h3>
    <p>
        Can append to or create variables specifically for a given target:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">target: my_variable (=|:=|?=|+=) value
target: prerequisites
&lt;tab&gt;    commands
#        ^^
#        my_variable now has a value specific to this target.</pre>
    <p></p>
</div> <!-- END: Variables -->

<h2>Including Other Make Files Into The Main Makefile</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Can include functionality from other Makefiles into the main Makefile using the <code>include</code> directive.
        Importantly <b>if any include file is updated by a file, make clears its internal database and re-reads the
        entire makefile</b>! This is especially important for <em>dependency generation</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The flow of logic that dictates when a Makefile is re-processed due to a rule-based update to an include
        target is shown below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="##IMG_DIR##/makefile_include_directive.png" alt="Makefile include directive processing workflow"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        This process is especially important for dependency generation which is covered in its own section.

<h2>Separate Source And Binary</h2>
<div>
    <p>CMake calls this sort of the out-of-source-builds. Need these to cope with multiple
    targets and multiple builds per target, for example. To accomplish need to have source
    and output binaries in separate locations!
