<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>
*** get.docker.com ***

Both virtualisation and containerisation decouple workloads from underlying hardware.
	Virtual machines MIMIC A HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT.
	Containers are OS LEVEL virtualisation.

Containers are lighter-weight. They add an additional layer of abstraction ontop of the host OS.
The still allow sandboxing applications and resource allocation and control etc.

Run apps on one machine in a way where they won't "meddle" with other apps on the same machine.
Eg. N projects, each with its own set of dependencies! Docker images help "sandbox" each project so
you can keep them all on the same machine without getting cross-interference.

More resource efficient than full VMs. Docker shares common ground between projects. Runs on Linux.
On windows its just a VM!

Portability across machines and environments - e.g. dependency version mismatch.

Docker container is not a VM on Linux. On Windows it can be, but depends on your windows version 
and method of Docker-install - Docker Toolbox v.s. Docker for Windows. The former uses VirtualBox
(type 2 hypervisor) and can only be accessed from the Docker Quickstart Terminal. The latter uses
the Windows hypervisor (type 1 hypervisor) and can be accessed from any terminal you like. There is
currently the restriction with the latter that you cannot run both the type1 hypervisor and
VirtualBox at the same time :( Toolbox access the daemon at 192.168.99.100 and have to use the
Docker terminal. On the latter you can use local host. 

VM - isolate system
Docket - isolate application

<h2>Docker and WSL</h2>
<h3>First Way I Tried</h3>
<pre>
!!! CAUTION - THIS IS NOW OUT OF DATE. NEW VERSIONS OF DOCKER DESKTOP HAVE BETTER SUPPORT - SEE !!!
!!! NEXT SECTION                                                                                !!!

Taken from here: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly#ensure-volume-mounts-work
Replicated verbatim:

	Install Docker
	==============

	# Update the apt package list.
	sudo apt-get update -y

	# Install Docker's package dependencies.
	sudo apt-get install -y \
	    apt-transport-https \
	    ca-certificates \
	    curl \
	    software-properties-common

	# Download and add Docker's official public PGP key.
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

	# Verify the fingerprint.
	sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

	# Add the `stable` channel's Docker upstream repository.
	#
	# If you want to live on the edge, you can change "stable" below to "test" or
	# "nightly". I highly recommend sticking with stable!
	sudo add-apt-repository \
	   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
	   $(lsb_release -cs) \
	   stable"

	# Update the apt package list (for the new apt repo).
	sudo apt-get update -y

	# Install the latest version of Docker CE.
	sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce

	# Allow your user to access the Docker CLI without needing root access.
	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

  # If still permission denied use
  sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock


	Connect to a remote Docker daemon with this 1 liner:
	====================================================
	echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
	# ALSO make sure in your Docker-for-windows settings that you have enabled the
	# "Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS" option.


	Ensure Volume Mounts Work
	=========================
	When using WSL, Docker for Windows expects you to supply your volume paths in a format that matches this: /c/Users/nick/dev/myapp.
	But, WSL doesn't work like that. Instead, it uses the /mnt/c/Users/nick/dev/myapp format.

		Running Windows 10 18.03+ or Newer?
		-----------------------------------
		sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf

		# Now make it look like this and save the file when you're done:
		[automount]
		root = /
		options = "metadata"

		# Now reboot your windows device.

		Running Windows 10 17.09?
		-------------------------
		udo mkdir /c
		sudo mount --bind /mnt/c /c
</pre>

<h3>A Better, Newer Way</h3>

<h2>Docker's Architecture</h2>
<pre>
Docker daemon, provides REST API, and the docker CLI client, which uses the REST API.

Docker container is a running instance of a docker image

Image - file system and parmeters - like a package containing everything you need to run your application
      - can download, build and run.
      - images are stored inside a registry. it's similar to a code repository, but holds Docker
        images.
      - lightwight executable packages that contain everything required in them, software, app
        code, dependencies etc etc.
      - Considered a read only artifact.
           !! NOTE this means that anything created in the Docker container that is not mapped to !!
           !! an external resource on the host is lost when the container is shutdown             !!
      - Created using Docker files - these detail how the Docker image should be built.
            - docker build

Container == running instance of a Docker image - like instance of a class
          Is immutable so any changes made whilst running them are lost on exit
          The container only has access to the resources provided in the Docker image unless
            external resources are mapped into the container.

Docker has 3 main components
	1. Docker daemon
		Install on host - "brain" of docker - performs/actons commands from the CLI and setup/run
		Docker containers.
	2. Docker CLI
		Way to interact with Docker - issue commands.
	3. Image registry
		Makes it possible for docker daemon to download and run an image


##-- alpine is only about 3MB so much better to download than ubuntu which could be seveal hundred MB.
##-- althernative is "slim"
docker run -it --rm --name alpine alpine sh 
           ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^
           ^^^ ^^^^ Custom unique name or handle to refer to instance by
           ^^^ Completely remove container when stopped
           be interactive and terminal (handle ctrl-c and colours etc)

The difference between `docker run` and `docker exec` is that `docker exec` executes a command on a running container whereas
`docker run` creates a temporary container, executes the command in it and stops the container when it is done.

docker stop alpine # to shut down the container

docker hub as auatomated build hooks - so if i push a change to my GitHub the docker registery can rebuild my image for me automatgiclaly.
</pre>

<h2>The Docker Build Process</h2>
<pre>
Ref: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd

1. Run docker container, modify then do "docker commit"
2. Docker file - blueprint or recipe for what you want your docker image to be - the best way (apparently)
	Docker ignore file - Docker looks for a file named .dockerignore in the root directory of build. If this file exists,
	the build excludes files and directories that match patterns in it. 

Docker images are layers, which are kinda like self-contained files and the docker image is the result of stacking up these layers.

First non-comment in docker file must be the "FROM" instruction (instruction names in caps) - import a base image to build on.
 	# FROM tag:version
 	FROM python:2.7-alpine
 	FROM ruby:2.4-alpine ## etc etc

FROM - The base image this new Docker image will be based on
     - It will be the very first instruction in any Docker file.
     - For example
           FROM python:2.7-alpine
                ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
                Image  Verion of image.
                name   (If left out, Docker assumes you want latest)


RUN - To run a command(s)
    - It will execute whatever commands you define in a shell
	# RUN -any script you can run in your base OS without Docker-
	RUN mkdir /app
	WORKDIR /app # change working directory for subsequent RUN commands
	COPY requirements.txt # You can use relative paths but cannot copy in files above the dockerfile.
	LABEL value="something" # Attach arbitrary metadata to an image (must use quotes for value)
	CMD - default command to  instance run.
		note RUN - build of image
		CMD - run when instance of image starts up]
      By default this is run as an argument to '/bin/sh -c'.
      The CMD instruction is being passed in as an argument to and ENTRYPOINT script (see later)

      CMD output probably doesnt go to docker logs: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55444575
          use &gt;&gt; /proc/1/fd/1   


EXPOSE - Expose a port on which the container can access the outside world on
         e.g. EXPOSE 8080 # Expose this port for the webapp.


ENTRYPOINT - Lets you define what script or command to run when the container starts up
             E.g. ENTRYPOINT [ "python" ]
             Generally ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...]
 
             From https://goinbigdata.com/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint/:
                ENTRYPOINT instruction allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
                It looks similar to CMD, because it also allows you to specify a command with parameters.
                The difference is ENTRYPOINT command and parameters are not ignored when Docker container
                runs with command line parameters. 

CMD - Execute commands at runtime, difference to ENTRYPOINT is that you can provide default values
      which can be overriden at runtime. Entrypoint can be overridden.
      E.g. CMD [ "app.py" ]
      Generally CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...]

      From https://goinbigdata.com/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint/:
        * CMD instruction allows you to set a default command, which will be executed only when you run
          container without specifying a command.
        * Docker container runs with a command, the default command will be ignored. If Dockerfile has
          more than one CMD instruction, all but last CMD instructions are ignored.

Example
--------
FROM python:2.7-alpine

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt # goes to /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . . #again /app - copies everything from local machine relative to dockerfile into our docker image.
LABEL maintainer="James James &lt;james.james@james.com&gt;" \
      version="1.0"
CMD flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000



Union File Systems and Copy on Write
-------------------------------------
VERY IMPORTANT HOW YOU ORDER THINGS! Each command/instruction will be a cached-layer so make sure
that more static large layers come first so that if something changes Docker won't have to redo a
lot of stuff (because cached layers below the layer that change stay the same but layers above it
must be redone).

Chain commands together where possible to avoid creating unecessary additional layers.

Layers can be cached across multiple Docker images for memory usage efficiency.

To see what layers the image has use the `Docker inspect IMG_ID` command. 

To achieve this layer Docker uses a UNION FILE SYSTEM. Many lays of filesystems appears to the
image as one single FS.
	If higher layer mods file in lower layer, copy is made in higher layer and modified then used.
	If it didn't do this every Docker image sharing the lower layer would see the change and this
	is not what is wanted! Called COPY-ON-WRITE strategy.

	Sharing layers helps reduce image size.

Docker adds one writable layer on top of your image so you can modify the FS, store things etc.
BUT TAKE CARE - this is not persistent by default and any data stored/chaged etc is lost when the
container is shutdown.


Cleanup / File System Size Easy Wins
------------------------------------
1. Purge any apps you installed to setup but won't need for the image to run:
       apt-get purge -y 
2. Do a general house clean:
       apt-get autoremove -y
       apt-get clean -y
       rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
       rm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives
       rm -fr /var/cache/debconf/*
 3. Get rid of man pages
       rm -rf /usr/share/doc/
       rm -rf /usr/share/man/
       rm -rf /usr/share/locale/
</pre>


<h2>Multi-Stage Builds</h2>
<div>
<p>
  The Docker docs have the following to say: <q>With multi-stage builds, you use 
    multiple <code>FROM</code> statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a
     different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy 
     artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't want in the final image.
     </q>
</p>
<pre>
  FROM &lt;base-image-a&gt; as &lt;build-stage-name&gt;
  ...
  Do something that generates an artefact that you want to copy to the next build stage
  ...

  FROM &lt;base-image-b&gt;  
  COPY --from=&lt;build-stage-name&gt; &lt;src&gt; &lt;dest&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  To mount a filesystem from a previous build stage into the current build stage:
</p>
<pre>
RUN --mount=type=bind,target=&lt;target-dir-in-this-stage&gt;,source=&lt;source-dir-in-previous-stage&gt;,from=&lt;build-stage-name&gt; \
    ... access &lt;target-dir-in-this-stage&gt; as required ...
    ...
</pre>
<p>
  You don't have to mount directories either... you can mount specific files from the host, which saves you having to <code>COPY</code> them into the image!
  Usefully there is also a <code>tmpfs</code> mount, which can be useful!
</p>
<p>
  Example of mounting external file system and tmpfs in a Dockerfile:
</p>
<pre>
RUN <b>--mount=type=tmpfs,target=/build_temp \
    --mount=type=bind,source=.,target=/build \</b>
       apt-get update --fix-missing \
    && apt-get -y upgrade \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends make \
    && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive make -C build -f Dockerfile.Makefile TEMP_DIR=/build_temp all 
</pre>
</div>

<H2>Misc Bits</H2>
<div>
    <h3>Stop TK install asking for timezone</h3>
    <div>
      <pre>RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y -q package</pre>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Use Bash, not Sh, as default shell</h3>
    <div>
      <pre>SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]</pre>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Use Host's XServer</h3>
    <div>
      <pre>
  xhost +"local:docker@"                          # if DISPLAY does not exist in your environment `export DISPLAY=":0"`
  docker container run \
      --rm -it \
      --env="DISPLAY" \
      --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" \
      --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix" \
      &lt;image-name&gt;
      </pre>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Pass USB devices to container</h3>
    <div>
      <pre>--device=/dev/usbtmc0</pre>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Run container with same UID/GUI as host user</h3>
    <div>
      <pre>--user $(id -u):$(id -g)</pre>
      <p>This tells the container to run with the current user id and group id so that any files
        it creates will have the correct user and group set (otherwise you get root root).</p>
    </div>
</div>

<H2>Docker CLI Command Cheat Sheet</H2>
<pre>
# Build Docker Images from CLI
$ docker image build -t web1:1.0 .
                     ^^     ^^^
                     ^^     the tag version
                     tag the image so that we dont have to use its random hash

$ docker image inspect web1

$docker image ls [-a]
$docker image rm &lt;tag:version&gt;|&lt;hash (image ID)&gt;

# Run/stop Docker Instances
$ docker container ls  [-a] # List running docker images (akak containers)
$ docker container run web1
$ docker container stop web1 or container-ID

# Ports
$ docker container run -p bind-port-on-host:bind-port-in-container

# Env var
$ docker container run -e SOME_VAR=some-value

# Logs and stats
$ docker container logs [-f] container-ID-or-name
$ docker container stats

# Auto restart
use docker run ... --restart on-failure ...

# Run as daemon and get logs
use '-d' flag
Then docker logs CONTAINER-ID

# Windows

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers
</pre>


<h2>Volumes</h2>
<pre>
Avoid the Kill-build-reload cycle every time you change your code. I.e. you change it, kill the
docker instance, rebuild the image, and re-run it... sigh!

Mount source code from main operating system straight into the running container. To do this use the
'-v' option.

   docker container run ... -v abs-path-on-host:path-to-mount-in-target

To specify a path on C:\ in windows do -v //c/path/to/wherever
</pre>


<h2>Dynamically Connect To Container And Run Commands</h2>
<pre>
Here you are connecting to an _already running_ container

$ docker container exec [--user] "$(id -u):$(id -g)"] -it the-name (bash|sh|cmd)
                        ^^^^^^^^
                        When running on linux host so that files created in docker are not owned
                        by root, but by you.

or to run a command once without an interactive shell
$ docker container exec "echo james" alpine
</pre>


<h2>Link Docker Containers Over A Network</h2>
<pre>
https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/
https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/
https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/
https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone

$docker network ls

Docker will have installed a virtual network adaptor. On windows I see it as:

   Ethernet adapter vEthernet (DockerNAT):

      Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
      IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.0.75.1
      Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
      Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :


On Linux I see it as:

   TODO

See the docker networks using
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
5c6e2a9ca9b2        bridge              bridge              local &lt;&lt; This is the virtual network adapter created oh your host as seen above (DockerNAT)
0aa3a20ed51a        host                host                local
bb9b8f0ffcd6        none                null                local

The bridge network is used by default. 
  In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to
  the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not
  connected to that bridge network.

Inspect it using:
$ docker network inspect bridge

NOTE: Conatiners are, by default, added to the bridge network unless you specify otherwise


To get DNS "out of the box" you need to configure your own network. 
   docker metwork create --driver bridge mynetworkmame

With new network supply "--net mynetworkname" to the "docker conatiner run..." command line.

Once this is done each container can be accessed using its name, rather than the IP address. Docker has
a little DNS server running for us that maps the container name to the IP address Docker assigned it :)
</pre>


<h2>Data Volumes a.k.a. Named Volumes</h2>
<pre>
Allow you to persist data.

Create using "docker volume create my_volume_name"
Use "docker volume inspect my_volume_name" to see things like its mountpoint in the container.

In stead of doing -v /local/path:/path/on/conatiner do my_volume_name:/path/on/container
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                        Name if volume created in prev step

See https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/:

> Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by
> Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and
> OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.
>
> Start a service with volumes
> When you start a service and define a volume, each service container uses its own
> local volume. None of the containers can share this data if you use the local
> volume driver, but some volume drivers do support shared storage.

</pre>


<h2>Entrypoints</h2>
<pre>
A command in the Docker file that auto-runs a script after the container has started

   ENTRYPOINT['/path/to/some/executable/script']

From some dynamic config you can create an environment variable tha the script can read to
change its execution directly

   Use -e ENV_VAR_NAME=value on the command line to the "docker container run" command.

Last line of your script must read
   exec "$@"
This is because, in your docker file, the CMD instruction is being passed in as an 
argument to your ENTRYPOINT script, so you must take care to run it, otherwise whatever was
in the CMD line in the docker file will not get run!
</pre>



<h2>Managing Docker</h2>
<pre>
docker system info
docker system df [-v] #&lt; See disk usage
docker system prune [-a] [-f] (Caution when using -a!!)
docker image ls #&lt; See images: images with &lt;none&gt; and dangling and can be killed
docker container stop $(docker container ls -a -q) #&lt; Stop all running containers
</pre>

<h2>BuildKit and Multi Stage Builds</h2>
<pre>
See:
	https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/
      With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM
      instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build.
      You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything
      you don't want in the final image.

Multi-stage builds = smaller containers, better caching, smaller security footprint.
	E.g. build container and production container where production container only contains build artefact not tools for build.


See:
  https://www.docker.com/blog/advanced-dockerfiles-faster-builds-and-smaller-images-using-buildkit-and-multistage-builds/
The latest Docker versions come with new opt-in builder backend BuildKit.

Enable using  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .
</pre>


<h2>Docker Compose</h2>

A note about volumes (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/):
  docker service create \
      --name my-service \
      --replicas 3 \
      --mount type=volume,source=my-volume,destination=/path/in/container,volume-label="color=red",volume-label="shape=round" \
      nginx:alpine
For each replica of the service, the engine requests a volume named "my-volume" from the default ("local") volume driver
where the task is deployed. If the volume does not exist, the engine creates a new volume and applies the labels.
When the task is started, the volume is mounted on /path/in/container/ inside the container.
 
The volume specified will create a *local* volume for each service container. See https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/.


From Overriding Dockerfile image defaults

Overriding Dockerfile image defaults:
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#overriding-dockerfile-image-defaults
    When a developer builds an image from a Dockerfile or when she commits it, the developer can set a number of default 
    parameters that take effect when the image starts up as a container. Four of the Dockerfile commands cannot be overridden 
    at runtime: FROM, MAINTAINER, RUN, and ADD. Everything else has a corresponding override in docker run.
</pre>

<p>
  <code>docker-compose build</code> will go through the YAML file and build any services with a <code>build</code> property.<br/>
  <code>docker-compose pull</code> will go through the YAML file and download any services with an <code>image</code> property.<br/>
  <code>docker-compose up [--build] [-d]</code> will start the project. <code>--build</code> combines the build step into this command and <code>-d</code> makes it run in the background.<br/>
  <code>docker-compose ps</code><br/>

<h2>Docker Swarm</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<pre>
Like: https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/docker-swarm

* Docker swarm is a clustering solution built inside Docker.
    * Clusters we care less about individual nodes. We don't name them - just throw requirements at
      swarm and swarm does the machanics of distributing round the swarm.
* Deploy & maintain many containers across many instances and automate the container lifecyle!
* A single service can have multiple tasks.  

* Swarm not active by default. Use `docker info` to see swarm status.
    * Use `docker swarm init [--advertise-addr IP_ADDR] [--listen-addr IP_ADDR]` to enable.
        * Use --advertise-addr to give a public address to advertise the swarm service on - must
          be accessible from other servers you want in the swarm.
        * Use "--listen-addr" when machine has multiple network interfaces and you want to bind to a specific one.
    * Creates root signing certficate created for the swarm, issued for first Manager node
    * Join tokens created - can be used on other nodes to join swarm
    * Create RAFT consensus DB
    * Creates the "leader" node.
        * docker node ls
          ID                            HOSTNAME         STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
          v6neb2hympfaejcdgjxqp92pu *   docker-desktop   Ready     Active         Leader           20.10.11

* Language:
    * A __node__ is an instance of the Docker engine participating in the swarm. Can run >= 1 node on a computer.
    * A __manager__ node dispatches units of work called tasks to worker nodes and perform the orchestration
      and cluster management.
        * Deploy swarm by submitting service definition to manager.        
    * __Worker__ nodes receive and execute tasks dispatched from manager nodes
    * A __service__ is the definition of the tasks to execute on the manager or worker nodes.

* Ports
    You need the following ports open between your swarm nodes:

    2377/tcp: Swarm mode api
    7946/both: Overlay networking control
    4789/udp: Overlay networking data
    protocol 50 for ipsec (secure option) of overlay networking

* Create service:
    * $ docker service create alpine ping 8.8.8.8
      mmib56y49ixo0v38xc8vqq24u                      # This is the SERVICE ID, not the container ID

    * $ docker service ls
      ID             NAME            MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE           PORTS
      mmib56y49ixo   laughing_bohr   replicated   1/1        alpine:latest

    * To see the task allocated to this service:
      $ docker service ps laughing_bohr
      ID             NAME              IMAGE           NODE             DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE           ERROR     PORTS
      m1328c1z8s92   laughing_bohr.1   alpine:latest   docker-desktop   Running         Running 2 minutes ago
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                       The service that this task is running on

    * Scale it up using          
      $ docker service update mmib56y49ixo --replicas 3        

      Which now means there are three tasks:
      $ docker service ps laughing_bohr
      ID             NAME              IMAGE           NODE             DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE            ERROR     PORTS
      m1328c1z8s92   laughing_bohr.1   alpine:latest   docker-desktop   Running         Running 5 minutes ago
      qsrs5ntvv9qm   laughing_bohr.2   alpine:latest   docker-desktop   Running         Running 21 seconds ago
      6jjw41tdp9w9   laughing_bohr.3   alpine:latest   docker-desktop   Running         Running 22 seconds ago

      IF YOU KILL A TASK, IT WILL BE RESTARTED AUTOMATICALLY BY SWARM!!

<h3>MultiPass</h3>
<p>
  Multipass lets you control multiple VM instances from one command line interface and has a docker image that comes
  with Docker pre-installed - usefull for messing around with swarm.
</p>

<pre># Launch an instance (by default you get the current Ubuntu LTS)
multipass launch --name foo [--cloud-init cloud-config.yaml] [image]
                             ^^^^^^                           ^^^^^ 
                             ^^^^^^                           Image to launch. Ommitted =&gt; default Ubuntu used
                             Pass a cloud-init metadata file 

# Run commands in that instance
multipass exec foo -- command-goes-here

# Open a shell prompt on an instance
mulutipass shell foo

# See all instances
multipass list

#Stop and start instances
multipass stop foo bar
multipass start foo

# Clean up
multipass delete bar
multipass purge

# Find alternate images to launch with multipass
multipass find

# Use VirtualBox (https://multipass.run/docs/using-virtualbox-in-multipass-windows)
multipass set local.driver=virtualbox

# Share data via Mounts
multipass [u]mount $HOME foo

<h3>Onto Network Overlays and Meshes...</h3>
<pre>
A small bit of revision....
From https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/nodes/
and https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/admin_guide/:
    A swarm consists of one or more nodes: physical or virtual machines running Docker Engine 1.12 or later in
    swarm mode. There are two types of nodes: managers and workers.

    Manager nodes handle cluster management tasks:
        * maintaining cluster state
        * scheduling services
        * serving swarm mode HTTP API endpoints
        * When you run a swarm of Docker Engines, manager nodes are the key components for managing the swarm and
          storing the swarm state.
        * Raft requires a majority of managers, also called the quorum, to agree on proposed updates to the swarm,
          such as node additions or removals ... If the swarm loses the quorum of managers, the swarm cannot perform
          management tasks ... Even if a swarm loses the quorum of managers, swarm tasks on existing worker nodes
          continue to run. However, swarm nodes cannot be added, updated, or removed, and new or existing tasks
          cannot be started, stopped, moved, or updated.
    Using a Raft implementation, the managers maintain a consistent internal state of the entire 
    swarm and all the services running on it. 

    When you have multiple managers you can recover from the failure of a manager node without downtime.
    An N manager cluster tolerates the loss of at most (N-1)/2 managers.

    Worker nodes are also instances of Docker Engine whose sole purpose is to execute containers. Worker nodes don't
    participate in the Raft distributed state, make scheduling decisions, or serve the swarm mode HTTP API.

    By default, all managers are also workers

    See https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/services/
        https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/pki/

        Like: https://sebiwi.github.io/blog/how-does-it-work-docker-3/

Back to course...

In the turorial create 3 VMs with docker installed.

On node 1:
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 142.93.44.156
# ^^ This should print out a join command that the other nodes can use.
# For example, the above printed out the following:

On the other nodes:
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-428pmulqy030ktqjwogyjw0nv49i45ytgc3pmw1q25xi6u3dkk-d282u6s5s0eb67tp9pts2pioj 142.93.44.156:2377

Workers cannot use swarm commands - priviledge limitation

To make a worker a manager Use
  docker node update --role manager nodeX

To add a node as a manager by default need to get the manager token:
  docker swarm join-token manager

You can change these tokens if you need to for security reasons.
They are stored encrypted on disk.

To see all the nodes do:
  docker node ls [--filter role=(worker|manager)]

Now, a service, replcated across our three nodes can be created:
  docker service create --replicas 3 alpine ping 8.8.8.8
  #                                  ^^^^^^ ^^^^
  #                                  ^^^^^^ Command to execute - i.e. the service function
  #                                  The image to use on the nodes to run the service
To see the service do:
  docker service ls

To see the gory details of/for a service:
  docker service inspect [--pretty] SERVICE_NAME

To see the service instance running on the various nodes do:
  docker service ps affectionate_ellis
  #                 ^^
  #                 Name docker assigned the service

On each node you can see the service instance that is running:
  docker node ps [node-name]
  #               ^^
  #               If omitted then current Node
 
Most tasks can now be orchestrated from node 1 - no need to exec commands in the
other nodes directly.


Network Overlays: Multi-Host networking
----------------------------------------
See for networking in swarm: https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/
  The overlay network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts.
  This network sits on top of (overlays) the host-specific networks, allowing containers
  connected to it (including swarm service containers) to communicate securely when encryption
  is enabled. Docker transparently handles routing of each packet to and from the correct Docker
  daemon host and the correct destination container.

  All swarm service management traffic is encrypted by default, using the AES algorithm in GCM
  mode. Manager nodes in the swarm rotate the key used to encrypt gossip data every 12 hours.

  To encrypt application data as well, add --opt encrypted when creating the overlay network

* Use docker `network create ... --driver overlay [--opt encrypted] ...` when creating network
* For intra-container comms only inside a single swarm
    * They can access eachother as-if on a VLAN
* Can enable full network encryption (IPSec (AES))
    * Off by default (perforamce reasons)
* Services can be connected to multiple networks.

Create:
  docker network create --driver overlay OVERLAY_NAME
See:
  docker network ls

In course example, create a drupal network
  docker service create \
      --name psql \
      --network mydrupal \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypass postgres
This will create the service on the current node (?). Can do, to see the service:
  [watch] docker service ls
And to see what's running in the service
  docker service ps psql
Can see logs
  docker service logs psql
You can get it directly from the container, but the container name may have stuff suffixed onto it
so do a `docker container ls` to find out its name. For me, for ex is was:
  docker container logs psql.1.qhv53a8qrka1wz31u7rm1bsku

Now create another service for drupal itself:
  docker service create --name mydrupal --network drupal -p 80:80 drupal


This gives us two services on two *different* nodes.
So, how can they talk: A: Use the SERVICE NAMES!! So when you configure the hostname for the DB in drupal setup
you can just use "psql" rather than needing to know an IP address!

There is some magic! I can access drupal on the IP of any of the nodes - the magic has to do with the ROUTING git_merge_squash



Routing Mesh
------------
* Routes ingress packets for a service to the tasks for that service which spans all the nodes...
* Spans all nodes in swarm
* Uses IP Virtual Server (IPVS) from Linux kernel
    * IPVS is the linux load balancer
    * Random ref: https://debugged.it/blog/ipvs-the-linux-load-balancer/
    * Load balances Swarm services across their Tasks.
    * Two ways of working:
      * Container-to-container in an overlay network
          * E.g. is FE talking the BE - if DB is duplicated the FE does not use DB real IP - instead uses
            a virtual IP (VIP), which the IPVS can then forward to any of the duplicated DBs.
            Swarm PUTS THIS VIP IN FRONT OF ALL SERVICES.
            Ensures load is distributed across all tasks in the service.
      * External traffic incoming to published ports:
          * All nodes listen to all published ports and can re-route traffic the the appropriate container.
          * This means that when deploying containers in a swarm you do not have to care what particular server it is on.
              * E.g. If container fails it could be re-incarnated on another node.
* Possible issues:
  * Issues
    * &lt;= 17.03 Routing mesh and load balancing are STATELESS - has impact on apps expectin sessions!
        * If you use session cookies or clients expect to talk with same container consistently across requests
          then need to add this functionality.
    * Layer 3 (IP) load balancer, not layer 4 (DNS)
  * Some solutions
    * NGINX or HAProxy
    * Use Docker Enterprise - comes with built-in L4 web proxy

Use this for playing around and teaching yourself docker and docker swarm.
https://github.com/bretfisher/udemy-docker-mastery

    docker network create --driver overlay frontend
    docker network create --driver overlay backend

    # Create the volume for the DB
    docker volume create db_volume

Swarm Stacks and Production Grade components
---------------------------------------------
* Extra layer of abstraction to Swarm called Stacks
* Stacks accept compose files as defn for services, networks, Volumes
     docker stack deploy # Rather than docer service create
* docker-compose cli not needed on swarm server
    * Not designed as a production tool anyway - just dev / syadm tool
* A stack is for only one swarm

From https://www.ronaldjamesgroup.com/article/docker-stack#:~:text=Docker%20Stack%20sits%20at%20a,grouped%20together%2C%20essentially%20pooling%20resources.:
How does Docker Stack help?
    Docker Stack sits at a higher level than Docker containers and helps to manage the 
    orchestration of multiple containers across several machines. Docker Stack is run 
    across a Docker Swarm, which is essentially a group of machines running the Docker 
    daemon, which are grouped together, essentially pooling resources.

    Stacks allow for multiple services, which are containers distributed across a swarm,
    to be deployed and grouped logically. The services run in a Stack can be configured
    to run several replicas, which are clones of the underlying container. This number
    will be maintained as long as the service is running. Adding or removing replicas
    of a service is simple. This makes Docker Services ideal for running stateless
    processing applications.

Main docs: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack/
           https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/

$ docker stack deploy -c compose-file.yml
#                     ^^
#                     Tell it to use a compose file

The course example compise file is
{{{

    services:

        redis:
            image: redis:alpine

docker stack ls

The stacks create APPs and each app has one or more SERVICES associated with it
    docker stack services APP_NAME  # Like a service ls
    docker stack ps APP_NAME        # Shows tasks not containers

In the stack compose file it is the deploy keywork that is unique to swarm:
    https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#deploy
    Specify configuration related to the deployment and running of services. This only
    takes effect when deploying to a swarm with docker stack deploy, and is ignored by
    docker-compose up and docker-compose run.

For CONSTRAINTS see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_create/#specify-service-constraints---constraint

Secret Storage & Usage In Swarm
--------------------------------
Secrets storage:
    * Built in to swarm
    * Easiest "secure" solution for storing secrets in Swarm
    * Docker >- 1.13 Raft DB encrypted on disk
        * Only stored on disk on manager nodes
        * Manager and works "control plane" is TLS + auth (key delivery)
        * Workers keep keys secure in memory only (RAMFS)

Pass secret using file (not so good if file stored on host):
    * docker secret create psql_user psql_user.txt
                           ^^^^
                           Secret Name
Or send it on STDIN
    * echo "password-bad-unless-hidden-from-bash-history" | docker secret create psql_user -

Neither of the above good for production!!

docker secret inspect NAME

These secrets will map to...
    /run/secrets/NAME
...for any node in a service which has the secret added to it

To create a service with a secret do
    docker secive create --name foo --secret SECRET_NAME --secret ANOTHER_SECRET_NAME ....
To tell processes how to use secrets things like environment variables set to their paths
can be given using the `-e ENV_VAR_NAME=/run/secrets/SNAME` option.

To use SECRETS IN STACKS you need >= version 3.1 in the YAML file. Pass in the secrets in much
the same way
{{
  version: "3.1"
  services:
      psql:
        ...
        secrets:
            - psql_user
            - psql_password
        ...
  
  secrets:
      psql_user:
          file: ./my_secrets_file.txt
          psql_password:
          file: ./my_secrets_other_file.txt
}}

Overriding Settings To Use Multiple Compose Files
-------------------------------------------------
1. Use a default compose file for the common settings across all environments (local, dev, prod etc)
   `docker-compose.yml`
2. Then use override file `docker-compose.override.yml`.
   This is a special filename that docker compose will automatically "include"

OR

Specify using `-f` where the command line order is the order that the YAML files are overlaid. E.g.:
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.my-environment.yml up -d

The result of "smooshing" these files together can be output as well:
    docker  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.my-environment.yml config > output.yml
                                                                       ^^^^^^
                                                                       Note the config command

There is also an EXTENDS option - does this work yet in Stacks?


Service Updates
---------------
* Provides rolling replacement of tasks/containers in a service
* There are also scale, rollback and healthcare options
    e.g. SCALE: docker service scale service_name=4
         ROLLBACK: docker service rollback service_name
* A stack deploy to an existing stack IS an update. Thats how you do an UPDATE.
* UPDATE IMAGE E.g. if image was prev 1.2.0:
    docker service update --image myapp:1.2.1 service-name
* ADD ENV
    docker service update d --env-add BLAH=BLAH
* ADD/DELETE PORT
    docker service update --publish-(add|rm) 8080


When you scale swarm doesn't move resource around so nodes could be unbalanced.

<h2>Urg</h2>
<pre>
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/admin_guide/
Raft requires a majority of managers, also called the quorum, to agree on proposed updates to the swarm, such as node additions or removals. Membership operations are subject to the same constraints as state replication.

If the swarm loses the quorum of managers, the swarm cannot perform management tasks. If your swarm has multiple managers, always have more than two

Raft tolerates up to (N-1)/2 failures and requires a majority or quorum of (N/2)+1 members to agree on values proposed to the cluster. This means that in a cluster of 5 Managers running Raft, if 3 nodes are unavailable, the system cannot process any more requests to schedule additional tasks. The existing tasks keep running but the scheduler cannot rebalance tasks to cope with failures if the manager set is not healthy.

A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments. 

Your application connection logic should include tolerance for automatic failovers and the subsequent elections. Starting in MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB drivers can detect the loss of the primary and automatically retry certain write operations a single time, providing additional built-in handling of automatic failovers and elections

The primary is the only member in the replica set that receives write operations. MongoDB applies write operations on the primary and then records the operations on the primary's oplog. Secondary members replicate this log and apply the operations to their data sets.

Replica sets should always have an odd number of members. This ensures that elections will proceed smoothly.

It is important to specify the “ — listen-addr” parameter when using docker-machine and VirtualBox, as the VMs are assigned multiple network interfaces.
docker@manager1:~$ docker swarm init --listen-addr 192.168.99.100:2377 --advertise-addr 192.168.99.100:2377

Useful reading about High Availability (HA) Clusters
----------------------------------------------------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain_(computing)
    It indicates data or availability inconsistencies originating from the maintenance of two separate data
    sets with overlap in scope, either because of servers in a network design, or a failure condition based
    on servers not communicating and synchronizing their data to each other. This last case is also commonly
    referred to as a network partition.

    Modern commercial general-purpose HA clusters typically use a combination of heartbeat network connections
    between cluster hosts, and quorum witness storage. The challenge with two-node clusters is that adding a
    witness device adds cost and complexity (even if implemented in the cloud), but without it, if heartbeat
    fails, cluster members cannot determine which should be active. In such clusters (without quorum), if a
    member fails, even if the members normally assign primary and secondary statuses to the hosts, there is
    at least a 50% probability that a 2-node HA cluster will totally fail until human intervention is provided,
    to prevent multiple members becoming active independently and either directly conflicting or corrupting data.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)#Heartbeat_network
    Heartbeat network is a private network which is shared only by the nodes in the cluster, and is not
    accessible from outside the cluster. It is used by cluster nodes in order to monitor each node's status
    and communicate with each other messages necessary for maintaining the operation of the cluster.

  * 4 types:
    1. Cluster IP
        Sets up user-friendly URLs to access pods. Only exposes pods in cluster.
        Good for setting up communications between pods in a cluster.

        The Load Balancer Service tells kunernetes to "reach out" to its provider and provision
        a load balancer. Gets traffic to a SINGLE pod. "Provider" means the cloud service etc,
        for example, AWS or Azure, that kubernetes is running on. The LB exists *outside* of any
        cluster we create - it is provisioned by the infrastructure that KB is running on.

        The Ingress or Ingress Controler is a pod with a set of routing rules to distribute traffic
        to other services. The LB does not know how to route specific URLs to the correct pod. It is
        a general load balancing mechanism. It is the Ingress Controller that is responsible for
        routing certain URLs to certain pods.

        - Automatic provisioning
        - Cloud provider only
        - Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)

    4. External name
        Redirects in-cluster requests to a CNAME url.

    5 **Ingress Routing**
        Not actually a service! From the K8S docs: You can also use Ingress to expose your Service.
        Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as the entry point for your cluster. It lets you
        consolidate your routing rules into a single resource as it can expose multiple services under
        the same IP address.

        From "Kubernetes for beginners article":
            > ... perhaps it could be reduced, contained, so that you would only need to allocate one

            > entrypoint...
            >
            > ...you write an Ingress manifest that declares how you would like clients to be routed
            > to a service. The manifest doesn't actually do anything on its own; you must deploy an

* Updating an image used by a deployment
    * Steps
        1. Deployment uses 'latest' tag in pod Spec
        2. Make update to code
        3. Build Docker image
        4. Push image to docker hub
        5. kubectl rollout restart deployment [depl_name]
    * Above is quite a hassle - intro SKAFFOLD to help!
      SKAFFOLD (skaffold.dev):
        * Automates many tasks in Kubernetes dev environment.
        * Makes it easy to update code in a running pod.
        * Makes easy to create/de;ete all objects tied to a project in on go
