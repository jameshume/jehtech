    <h2>Processes</h2>
    <p>
        A process has its own independent address space, isolating it from all other processes
        in the system. I.e., a process cannot access the memory of another processes directly.
        This first process in a Linux system is the <code>init</code> process, with a PID of 1. Each
        process in the system is assigned a unique integer to identify it, called the Process IDentifier,
        or PID.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processes are created in Linux by <code>fork()</code>ing an existing process. In the
        beginning Linux would copy the processes in its entirety: the parent process' memory would be cloned
        for the new child process and the page tables for the child would be created to
        &quot;point&quot; correctly to the new memory. That's <em>expensive</em> as the
        system has to copy a potentially large amount of memory. For example, if a huge processes
        using, say, 1.5GB of RAM just wanted to <code>exec</code> a really small utility, the 1.5GB
        of memory is copied only to be immediately used for a process requiring minimal memory, say
        5MB! What a waste of time!
    </p>
    <p>
        That is why <b>modern Linux now uses <em>copy-on-write pages</em></b>. This way the memory space of the
        parent processes is only copied to the child if the child tries to write to it. Therefore,
        in the above example, the parent and child will share the same memory until the child
        <code>exec</code>s another program. Therefore the potentially huge memory copy is avoided.
        Should the child modify the shared memory, a copy of the addressed memory page(s) are
        created for the child, but only the modified pages need be copied, so it is again as
        efficient as possible.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            ... Under Linux, fork(2) is implemented using <b>copy-on-write pages</b>, so the only penalty
            incurred by fork(2) is the time and memory required to duplicate the parent's page
            tables, and to create a unique task structure  for  the  child. However, in the bad
            old days a fork(2) would require making a complete copy of the caller's data space,
            often  needlessly...

<h2>Create Daemons</h2>

    </ul>

    <h3>What Is A Daemon?</h3>
    <p>
        A daemon is a Linux process that runs &quot;in the background&quot;. This means that it is
        not visible to the user: it does not output anything to the screen, via a terminal, for
        example. It is also a direct child of <code>init</code> so that it is not dependent on
        any other process staying alive (at least directly).
    </p>

<h2>File System Notifications</h2>
<div>
    <a name="inotify"></a>
    <h3>INotify</h3>
    <p>
        You can use the <code>inotify</code> APIs to &quot;listen&quot; for events relating
        to individual files or even directories.
    </p>
    <p>
        You create inotify handles to which you can add watch groups to. This handle can
        then be used to receive events on all of the groups of files/directories that you
        are watching.
    </p>
    <p>
        So lets, for example, watch a directory. You can
        <a href="https://github.com/jameshume/MessingWithC/blob/master/inotify/monitor_fs.cpp" target="_blank">
        get the example code here</a>. I won't just splurge it all out here, we'll just look at the important bits.
    </p>
    <p>
    	To start receiving events relating to files/directory you need to create an inotify file descriptor:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">int inotifyFd = inotify_init();</pre>
    <p>
    	To tie a directory/file to this file descriptor use the following:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">watchDescriptor = inotify_add_watch(inotifyFd, argv[1], IN_ALL);</pre>
    <p>
    	In the example code I do no command line checking so the first argument to the script is the file
    	or directory being watched. The macro <code>IN_ALL</code> is my own macro that is just a combination
    	of all the types of events that can be received.
    </p>
    <p>
    	To receive events you must <code>read()</code> from the inotify file descriptor:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">bytesRead = read(inotifyFd, buffer, sizeof(buffer))</pre>
    <p>
    	Here is the main point to note here is that the size of the <code>buffer</code> is
    	much larger than <code>sizeof(struct inotify_event)</code>! The reason for this is
    	that the <code>inotify_event</code> strcture contains as its last member an unsized
    	array. I think this was a C99 thing and I'm not sure it is even officially supported
    	in C++, but not getting any errors or warnings so it looks fine.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The last element <code>name</code> is an unsized array, which means that the actual size
    	of the array is the <code>sizeof(struct inotify_event) + inotify_event.len</code>, where
    	the <code>len</code> field gives the byte-length (includes all null bytes after string).
    </p>
    <p>
    	This is why I read data into <code>buffer</code>. To read at least one event <code>buffer</code>
    	needs to be at least <code>sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1</code> bytes in size. Note
    	that reading events will only read entire events, it will never split an event structure across
    	two reads, for example, therefore you can be certain to only ever read an integer number
    	of events.
    </p>
    <p>
    	So the <code>buffer</code> has one or possibly more events in it. Hence once
    	<code>read()</code> fills the buffer we must traverse across all the
    	<code>inotify_events</code> contained within:
    </p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">const char *const bufferEnd = buffer + bytesRead;
while(buffer &lt; bufferEnd)
{
   struct inotify_event *iNotifyEvent = reinterpret_cast&lt;struct inotify_event *&gt;(buffer);
   dump_inotify_event(iNotifyEvent);
   buffer += sizeof(struct inotify_event) + iNotifyEvent->len;
}</pre>
	<p>
		This code does a <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, which means the buffer must
		be correctly aligned: if you statically allocate a buffer you must make sure it is
    	correctly aligned. To work around this I've dynamically allocated the buffer which
    	guarantees correct alignment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The address of <code>buffer[0]</code> is the start of the first event struct.
		To get to the start of the next structure we forward the pointer
		<code>sizeof(struct inotify_event) + iNotifyEvent->len</code> bytes. This is the
		size of the structure plus the size of the file name string <em>and</em> all of the
		NULL bytes after it: the name has the terminating NULL byte but also as many extra
		NULL bytes required to pad the subsequent structure to the correct alignment.
		Thus we can increment the pointer in this way without
    	worrying about alignment within the buffer. Happy days!
	</p>
	<p>
		To cleanup we must remove the watch on the directory/file and then close the
		inotify descriptor:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">inotify_rm_watch(inotifyFd, watchDescriptor);
close(inotifyFd);</pre>
</div>

<a name="select_poll_epoll"></a>
<h2>Select, Poll, EPoll</h2>
<div>
    <a name="select"></a>
	<h3>Select</h3>
	<p>
		The Linux man page says that:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			select() ... allow[s] a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting
			until one or more of the file descriptors become &quot;ready&quot; for some class of
			I/O operation ... (e.g. without blocking or a sufficiently small write) ...
		</p>
		<footer>-- <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html" target="_blank">Linux Man Pages</a></footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Select will wait on a set of file descriptors with a timeout. You specify three sets of
		file descriptor to watch for three different events:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>File descriptors becoming ready for reading,</li>
		<li>File descriptors becoming ready for writing,</li>
		<li>File descriptors suffering exceptional conditions.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The sets of file descriptors being watched for events are described by <code>fd_set</code>s.
		A set is created and manipulated as follows:
	</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">fd_set fd_set;
FD_ZERO(&amp;fd_set);                        // CLEAR the set
FD_SET(file_descriptor, &amp;fd_set);        // ADD a file descriptor to the set
FD_CLR(file_descriptor, &amp;fd_set);        // REMOVE a file descriptor to the set
if (FD_ISSET(file_descriptor, &amp;fd_set))  // TEST if fd is part of set
   ; // file_descriptor is part of fd_set</pre>
   <p>
		Note that <code>select()</code> overwrites the <code>fd_set</code> variables you
		pass it so, if you use it in a loop remember to re-initialise the set each time!
   </p>
