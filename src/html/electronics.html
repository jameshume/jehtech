			<h3>Conventional Current And Charge</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/conventional_current.png" width="150" style="float:left">
				Historically positive charge moves through the circuit from the positive to negative terminals. This is called <em>conventional</em> current.
				We now know that it is, in fact, the flow of electrons from the negative to positive terminals that is current. Due to the historical precedent,
				current is still often shown as conventional current.
			</p>
			<p>
				From Wikipedia: <q>Conventional current flows from the positive pole (terminal) to the negative pole. Electrons flow from negative to positive. In a direct current (DC) circuit, current flows in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive. In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and the direction of the current (electron flow) reverses periodically.</q>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that voltages are relative, which is why the negative terminal of the battery can be negative - it depends what
				the reference voltage you are measuring against is - e.g. if ground is midway between the two terminals then they will
				have voltages -A and +A respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Informally, <b>current is a flow of electric charge</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Current, $i$, is the amount of charge, $q$, that moves through a point in the circuit at any time.
				$$i = \frac{\mathrm dq}{\mathrm dt}$$
				Charge, $q$, is measured in Coulombs. One electron has a charge of $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs. This is the smallest
				unit of charge possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can integrate the above to get $I = \frac{Q}{t}$ and therefore $Q = It$.
			</p>

			<h3 style="clear: both;">Voltage</h3>
			<p>
				Voltage, $V$, is the amount of work (in Joules) that must be done per unit charge to move between two points in a field.
				$$V_{ab} = \frac{\mathrm dw}{\mathrm dq}$$
				I.e. 1 volt is 1 Joule per Coulomb.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we integrate both sides of the abote w.r.t to charge we get:
				$$VQ = W\ \therefore W = QV$$
			</p>
			<p>
				To help understand this let's revisit the terms energy, work and power.<br/>
			</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 16pt;">
				<b>Energy</b> is the ability to do work.<br/>
				<b>Work</b> is the force that must be exerted to move a mass a certain distance.<br/>
				<b>Power</b> is the rate at which energy is generator/consumed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Energy is what makes it possible to move things. Moving things involves doing work and it takes energy to do this. <b>Energy measures
					the total amount of work done</b>. It does not say how fast the energy was used/produced.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Power gives that rate at which energy is used/produced</b>. Power measures how <b>fast</b> the work gets done.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/work_evergy_power.svg" alt="Image showing work and energy vs power"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Give these definitions we can see how they are defined for electronics. Using some crude (read incorrect as we're using multiplication not integration to make it seem simpler) we see:

				$$
				\begin{align}
				E &= IVt \\
				  &= \frac{\mathrm dq}{\mathrm dt} \cdot \frac{\mathrm dw}{\mathrm dq} \cdot t\\
				  &= \frac{\mathrm dW}{\mathrm dt} \cdot t \\
				  &= W
				\end{align}
				$$

				So energy is indeed the total work required to move a charge between two points in an electric field.

				And because 

				$$
				P = IV = \frac{E}{t}
				$$

				We can see that electrical power (measured in <b>Watts</b>) is the rate of consumption/generation of electrical energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that electric potential energy is measured with respect to a reference point. In the
				image below one can see that the voltage either side of the resistor is measured w.r.t ground.
				Ground is the normal reference point, but any point in a circuit can be used as long as it is
				used consistently.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/voltage_needs_a_reference.svg" alt="Measuring potential requires a reference voltage, usually ground"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Note then, that potential <em>difference</em>, is the difference between to points, each of which has
				a potential <em>energy</em> w.r.t to a reference. The potential <em>difference</em> is the difference between these
				two points, but <em>only make sense if the potential of each point is measured w.r.t to the same reference</em>.
			</p>

			<h3 style="clear: both;">Ohm's Law</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Ohm's law gives the relationship between voltage, current and resistance:
				</p>
				<p>
					$$V = IR$$
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3 style="clear: both;">Kirchoff's Laws</h3>

			<h4>Nodes, Branches and Loops</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Branch</b>: A branch represents a single element such as a resistor. I.e., any two terminal element.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Node</b>: A node is the point of connection between 2 or more branches. Every point going into the
				node, at the node, is at the same potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Loop</b>: A loops is any closed path in a circuit. Starts and ends at the same node
				and does not pass through a node more than once.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/loops_nodes_branches.png" alt="Branches, loops and nodes in a ciruite"/>
			</p>

			<h4>The Laws...</h4>
			<p>
				Two important laws: <em>Kirchoff's voltage law</em> and <em>Kirchoff's current law</em>.
			</p>
			<h5>KCL</h5>
			<p>
				Kirchoff's current law says that the <b>sum of currents flowing into a node must equal the sum of currents leaving</b> a node.
				This is often expressed in another way: the sum of currents entering and leaving a node must always be zero. This works because we label, by convention, all currents entering the node as positive and all currents leaving the node as negative.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/kcl_kvl.png" alt="KCL"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				This can be written most compactly as:

				$$
					\sum_{j=0}^{n} I_j = 0
				$$
			</p>
			<p>
				Lets look at the following example REF(`REF_UTUBE_CIRC_ANAL',`[Ref]'):
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h5>KVL</h5>
			<p>
				Kirchoff's voltage law says that the <b>sum of voltages around a closed circuit must be zero</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/kvl.png" alt="KVL"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				This can be written most compactly as:

				$$
					\sum_{j=0}^{n} V_j = 0
				$$
			</p>
			<p>
					Say, for example, that $V_1$ is 12V, R2 is $4 \Omega$, R3 is $6 \Omega$, $V_2$ is 3V and R5 is $1 \Omega$.
					Then we know $-12 + 4i + 6i - 4 + i = 0$. We can then work out the current in the circuit using KVL
					by re-arranging the formula.
			</p>
		</div>



		<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
		<h2>Resistance</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Resistors control the current that flows through a part of a circuit, as described by Ohm's Law ($V = IR$). Using
				the formula one can see that as either resistance increases, current falls, and vice versa.
			</p>
			<h3 style="clear:both;">Resistor Colour Codes</h3>
			<div>
				<canvas id="myCanvas" width="360" height="540" style="margin: 10px; border:1px solid #000000; float: left;">
				</canvas>
				<p>
					In the drawing to the left you can click on the value-boxes to change the colour bands on
					the resistor to find out the resistance represented by the colour encoding. Note it only shows
					a 4-band resistor. 5 and 6 colour bands are possible but not shown here.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: Sometimes the click event on the canvas doesn't fire... not quite sure why that is. If first click
					doesn't work, persevere :)
				</p>
				<p>
				Some popular ways of remembering the resistor colour codes include 
				&quot;<u>B</u>ad <u>B</u>oys <u>R</u>avish <u>O</u>ur <u>Y</u>oung <u>G</u>irls <u>B</u>ut <u>V</u>iolet <u>G</u>ives <u>W</u>illingly&quot; 
				and my fav, 
				&quot;<u>B</u>ad <u>B</u>ooze <u>R</u>ots <u>O</u>ur <u>Y</u>oung <u>G</u>uts, <u>B</u>ut <u>V</u>odka <u>G</u>oes <u>W</u>ell&quot;.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3 style="clear:both;">Resistor's In Series</h3>
			<div>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/resistors_in_parallel.png" width="300" style="float:left">
				<p>
					Resistors in series can be &quot;collapsed&quot; into an equivalent single resistor with a resistance that
					is the sum of all the resistances of the individual resistors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using <em>Kirchoff's voltage law</em>:

					$$V_1 + V_2 + V3 - V_s = 0$$

					Using $V = iR$ we can substitute in for the individual voltages across each resistor. Note that because
					this is a closed loop the current though each resistor will be the same (as there is no path in which
					the current can &quot;split&quot; up).

					$$iR_1 + iR_2 + iR3 - V_s = 0$$
					$$\therefore V_s = iR_1 + iR_2 + iR3$$

					Now, $V_s$ can also be re-written using $V = iR$ as $V_s = iR_t$, where $R_t$ is the equivalent, total,
					resistance of the resistors in series...

					$$\therefore iR_t = iR_1 + iR_2 + iR3$$
					$$\mathbf{\therefore R_t = R_1 + R_2 + R_3}$$
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3 style="clear:both;">Resistor's In Parallel</h3>
			<div>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/resistors_in_par.png" width="400" style="float:left">
				<p>
					Resistors in parallel can also be &quot;collapsed&quot; into an equivalent single resistor...
				</p>
				<p>
					Using <em>Kirchoff's current law</em> we can say that $i_t = i_1 + i_2 + i_3$. Using $V = iR$,
					we can say the following:

					$$
					\begin{array}{ccc}
						V = i_1R_1 & V = i_2R_2 & V = i_3R_3 \\
						\therefore i_1 = \frac{V}{R_1} & \therefore i_2 = \frac{V}{R_2} & \therefore i_3 = \frac{V}{R_3}
					\end{array}
					$$

					Substituting the above back into $i_t = i_1 + i_2 + i_3$, gives us the following.

					$$
					i_t = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_3}
					$$

					And, of course, $i_t$ can also be re-written, giving the solution:

					$$
					\frac{V}{R_t} = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_3}
					$$
					$$
					\mathbf{\therefore \frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}}
					$$
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3 style="clear:both;">Voltage Divider</h3>
			<div>
				<a name="voltage_divider"></a>>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/voltage_divider.png" width="200" style="float:left"/>
				<p>
					Using Ohm's law we know the following.
					$$V_1 = iR_1 \implies i = \frac{V_1}{R_1}$$
					$$V_2 = iR_2 \implies i = \frac{V_2}{R_2}$$

					Using Kirchoff's voltage law, and substituting in the above, we know that,
					$$\begin{align}
					V_t & = V_1 + V_2 \\
					    & = iR_1 + iR_2 \\
						 & = i(R_1 + R_2)
					\end{align}$$

					This means that we can say,

					$$i = \frac{V_t}{R_t} = \frac{V_1}{R_1} = \frac{V_2}{R_2}$$

					Substituting $i = \frac{V_1}{R_1}$ into $V_t = i(R_1 + R_2)$ gives...

					$$V_t = \frac{V_1}{R_1}(R_1+R_2)$$
					$$\mathbf{\therefore V_1 = V_t \times \frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}}$$

					Substituting $i = \frac{V_2}{R_2}$ into $V_t = i(R_1 + R_2)$ gives...

					$$V_t = \frac{V_2}{R_2}(R_1+R_2)$$
					$$\mathbf{\therefore V_2 = V_t \times \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}}$$

					In words, we can say that <em>the voltage across the second resistor is proportional to the ratio of the second resistance to the total resistance</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					One issue to be aware of is that any load placed across $R_2$, i.e., in parallel with $R_2$, will
					change the effective resistance of that node (remember resistors in parallel can be &quot;collapsed&quot; into an equivalent 
					single resistor). Therefore, be aware that the load across $R_2$ will also influence the ratio of voltage division.

			<h3 style="clear:both;">The Wheatstone Bridge</h3>
			<div>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/wheatstone_bridge.png" width="300" style="float:left">
				<p>
					The <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slyp163/slyp163.pdf" target="_blank">Wheatstone Bridge</a> is a circuit for measuring resistance 
					very accurately. This material is based on the link to the Texas Instrument tutorial...
				</p>
				<p>
					Using Kirchoff's voltage law around the loop consisting of $R_2$, $V_{out}$ and $R_4$ we get the following.

					$$-V_2 + V_{out} + V_4 = 0$$
					$$\therefore V_{out} = V_2 - V_4$$

					We can find the voltage across $R_2$ and $R_4$ by using the formula for voltage dividers: $R_1$ and $R_2$ are
					one voltage divider and $R_3$ and $R_4$ are the other voltage divider. Using the voltage divider formula we get
					the following two results:

					$$V_2 = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} \times V_t, \qquad V_4 = \frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4} \times V_t$$

					Here $V_t$ is the supply voltage. Substituting these into the first formula we get...

					$$
					\begin{align}
					V_{out} & = \left(\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} \times V_t\right) - \left(\frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4} \times V_t\right) \\
					        & = \left(\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} - \frac{R_4}{R_3+R_4}\right) \times V_t
					\end{align}
					$$

					If three out of the four resistances are known and the current across the $V_{out}$ branch is zero, the
					third resistance can be calculated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's say that we don't know the resistance of $R_3$. If we set all the other resistors to be equal so that
					$R_1 = R_2 = R_4$, then the above formula simplified to the following....

					$$V_{out} = \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{R_k}{R_u+R_k}\right) \times V_t$$

					Where $R_k$ is the known resistance and $R_u$ is the unknown resistance. This assumes that $R_u$ is roughly equal to $R_1$
					and that all $R_k$ resistors are very closely matched.
				</p>

				<p>
					A simple re-arrangement gives us...

					$$V_{out} = \frac{1}{2} \times V_t - \frac{R_k}{R_u+R_k} \times V_t$$
				</p>
				<p>
					In the above, $V_{out}$, $V_t$, and $R_k$ are all known. We know $V_{out}$ because we can measure it and the
					other known parameters are already set a-priori. With more simple re-arrangement we get...

					$$0.5V_t - V_{out} = \frac{R_k}{R_u+R_k} \times V_t $$
					$$\therefore \frac{0.5V_t - V_{out}}{V_t} = \frac{R_k}{R_u+R_k} $$
					$$\therefore \frac{V_t}{0.5V_t - V_{out}} = \frac{R_u + R_k}{R_k} $$
					$$\therefore \frac{V_t \cdot R_k}{0.5V_t - V_{out}} = R_u + R_k $$
					$$\therefore \mathbf{R_u = \frac{V_t \cdot R_k}{0.5V_t - V_{out}} - R_k} $$
				</p>

				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/wheatstone_is_non_linear.png" width="400" style="float:left;">

				<p>
					And now we can calculate the unknown resistance... why is this useful? Because <em>this unknown resistance is our sensor</em>.
					It could be a thermistor, LDR, or whatever... something that changes resistance due to the thing we're trying to measure.
				</p>
				<p>
					One thing to note is that the $V_{out}$ of the Wheatstone Bridge is non-linear as the figure to the
					left shows: $V_{out}$ does not change linearly with changes in the unknown resistance $R_u$! In the figure I just
					picked pretty arbitrary values for the various knowns.
				</p>
				<p>
					So... why use this rather complex arrangement to measure an unknown resistance when we could do
					the same using a simple voltage divider? The answer lies in the <em>sensitivity</em> of the measurement
					system. This is covered in the next section.

			<h3 style="clear:both;">Power</h3>
			<div>
				<p>When current flows through a resistor it dissipates power in the form of heat. When it flows
					through an LED it dissipates power in the form of both heat and light.
				</p>
				<p>
					Power, measured in <b>watts</b>, is defined as:
					$$
					P = VI = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}
					$$
				</p>
				<p>
					Resistors usually have a power rating (the power they can dissipate) associated with them.
					This means that if you know
					the resistor's power rating you can calculate the maximum voltage or current you can
					put across/through them without breaking the resistor.

		<h2>Voltage Sources &amp; Current Sources, Ideal v.s. Real World</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Voltage Sources</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					An <em>ideal</em> voltage source is one that supplies constant potential, no matter
					what load is connected to it. I.e., it produces whatever current is necessary to
					maintain the voltage across it REF(REF_SO_I_SRC, `[Ref]'):
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="##IMG_DIR##/ideal_voltage_source.svg" alt="Image explaining an ideal voltage source"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					But, <a href="electronics-batteries.html">batteries</a>, even power supplies etc etc
					are <em>not</em> ideal. In the real world
					they have a small internal resistance, anywhere between approx 0.1 OHM() to 2 OHM() depending on the battery
					REF(`REF_BATT_INT_RES', `[Ref]'), which means they are modelled more like this:
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="##IMG_DIR##/nonideal_voltage_source.svg" alt="Image explaining a non-ideal, real world, voltage source"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					It can be seen that because the internal resistance of the battery, is in series with the circuit it is powering,
					i.e., the load (simulated by the resistor), the combination acts like a <a href="#voltage_divider">voltage divider</a>,
					and so the voltage across the load varies with its resistance. I.e.,the battery is not ideal (but its pretty close!)
				</p>
				<p>
					This is why it is always best to measure the voltage across a power supply when it is under load.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can now also understand that an ideal voltage source is one that has zero internal resistance.
				</p>

			</div>

			<h3>Current Sources</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					An <em>ideal</em> current source is one that always produces the same current, no matter how
					the voltage across it or the resistance of the load it is &quot;feeding&quot; varies, REF(REF_SO_I_SRC, `[Ref]').
				</p>
				<p>
					This is why, incidently, in a circuit you cannot have two current sources in series!
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Source Transformations</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					It is possible to switch out a voltage source in a circuit for a current source and vice-versa
					using source transformation using Thevenin and Norton equivalent ciruits REF(`REF_UTUBE_CIRC_ANAL',`[Ref]').
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Superposition</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Circuits can have multiple sources. In this case, to determine voltage levels at nodes, the
					principle of superposition can be used:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Set all sources to zero except one,</li>
					<li>Solve the necessary currents and voltages using only that source,</li>
					<li>Repeat the above step for each source</li>
					<li>Add the circuit values together - &quot;superimpose&quot; them onto one another.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Take the following example REF(`REF_UTUBE_CIRC_ANAL',`[Ref]'):
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="##IMG_DIR##/superposition.svg" alt="Circuit analysis using superposition theorem"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the above diagram we get:
					$$
						\begin{align}
						I_1 &= I_1' + I_1'' \\
						I_2 = I_2' + I_2''
						\end{align}
					$$

		<h2 style="clear:both;">Switches</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Switches are defined by the number of poles and throws they have...
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Poles</b>: A switch pole refers to the number of separate circuits that the switch controls.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Throw</b>: The number of throws indicates how many different output connections each switch pole can connect its input to.
				Think of it as how many places a single source can be &quot;thown to&quot;.

		<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
		<h2 style="clear:both;">Capacitance</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulator (a.k.a. a dielectric).
			</p>
			<p>
				When connected to a voltage source, the source creates a positive charge on one plate
				and a negative one on the other plate:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/capacitor.png" alt="Pici of a capacitor with charge on both plates"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Charge stored is <b>proportional</b> to applied voltage:
				$$
					Q = CV \implies C = \frac{Q}{V}
				$$
				Where $C$ is called the <b>capacitance</b> of the capacitor and is measured in Farads (F).
				Note that $C$ is the <b>constant of proportionality</b> here!
			</p>
			<p>
				Although, for equations etc., Farads are the expected units, in electronics capacitors in the
				range of nano-Farads to milli-Farads are used. Even milli-Farads are less common. More common
				are nano and micro-Farads.
			</p>
			<p>
				By re-arranging the above we can see that <b>capacitance is the charge per volt that
				the capacitor can store</b>. Thus, the more charge that the capacitor stores per volt, the
				higher its capacitance is. This quantity is dependent on the type of dielectric used,
				the surface area of each plate and the distance between the plates.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recall that current is the amount of charge that moves past a point per unit time. Thus,
				by differentiating w.r.t time, the above, we get the current-voltage relationship of a cap:
				$$
					I = C\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t}
				$$
				This gives us in important property of caps. Because for DC current the voltage does not change,
				$\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t}$ is zero, so a <b>capacitor is an open circuit to DC</b>! (But it
				does charge).
				Because of the definition of a derivative, we also know that the voltage across a cap must
				be smooth - i.e., it cannot change abruptly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that real capacitors dissipate their energy over time - they &quot;leak&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Capacitors resist abrupt changes in voltage</b>, which is why the function
				as <b>low pass filters</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example graphs showing voltage across a capacitor whilst charging and current
				over time:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/electronics_capacitor_charge_graphs.png" alt="Example graphs showing voltage across a capacitor whilst charging and current over time">
			</p>

			<h3>Energy And Work</h3>
			<p>
				We had previously defined work as $W = QV$, but this assumes a <em>constant voltage and current flow</em>.
				But, as a capacitor charges the voltage and current change with time. At time $t=0$, the charge stored
				by the capacitor is zero, and as the capacitor charges, the voltage across it increases too.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, the work required to charge a capacitor, i.e., the work done by the power source, is:
				$$W = \frac{1}{2}QV$$
				We have also said that $Q = CV$, therefore we can re-write the above as,
				$$W = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$$
				And because $V=\frac{Q}{C}$, we can re-write it again as,
				$$W= \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$$
			</p>

			<h3>Charging Without A Resistor Means Trouble</h3>
			<p>
				If a capacitor is charged without a resistor to limit current the circuit will, at the
				beginning of the charge, be a <b><i>short circuit</i></b>. In the diagrams above, a spark will be seen
				at the switch which will dissipate some of the energy. As we will see below, exactly half of
				the energy is dissipated in the spark and that the maths kinda fails for this scenario...
			</p>
			<p>
				Take the following example...
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/cap_5uf_10V_supply_short_citcuit.png" alt="5 micro Farad capacitor short-circuit connected to 10V batt"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				We know the work done by the capacitor when it discharges is defined as follows, giving the following result.
				$$
				\begin{align}
					W &= \frac{1}{2}CV^2 \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 10^{-6} \cdot 10^2 \\
						&= 2.5\cdot 10^{-4} \text{Joules}
				\end{align}
				$$
				We should now be able to plug the value for $W$, and $V$ back into the equation for the work done by the battery, $W = \frac{1}{2}QV$:
				$$
					2.5\cdot 10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2}Q\cdot 10 \\
					\therefore Q = 5\cdot 10^{-5} \text{Coulombs}
				$$
			
			</p>


			<h3>Charging Through A Resistor</h3>
			<p>
				When a capacitor, with a capacitance $C$, charges in series through a resistor of resistance $R$ ohms,
				in $RC$ seconds it will charge to 63% of the supply voltage and in
				$5 \times RC$ seconds it charges to over 99% <a href="http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/How-long-does-it-take-to-charge-a-capacitor" target="_blank">[Ref]</a>.
				You get an <em>exponentially decreasing current flow</em> as the <em>resistor draws current</em>
				from the battery and the <em>capacitor stores the current's flowing charge</em> <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~nas2173/Lab8_CapacitanceAndTheOscilloscopeNS.pdf" target="_blank">[Ref]</a>.

				$$
					\tau \ \text{(in seconds)} = RC \\
					\\
					63\% \text{ charge in } 1\cdot RC \text{ seconds} \\
					99\% \text{ charge in } 5\cdot RC \text{ seconds}
				$$
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/capacitor_charge_e.png" alt="Capacitor charging through a resistor"/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Recall KVL: the sum of voltages around a closed circuit must be zero. The dotted arrow
				in the diagram above shows a direction around a closed ciruit, which by KVL means that REF(`REF_SO_CAP_EQUATIONS', `[Ref]'):

				$$
				\begin{array}{l l}
				+V_s(t) - V_r(t) - V_c(t) = 0&\ \text{from KVL law,} \\
				\therefore\  V_s(t) = V_r(t) + V_c(t)&\ \text{by rearrangement,} \\
				\therefore\  V_s(t) = R \cdot I(t) + V_c(t)&\ \text{by substiting from}\ V_r(t) = R \cdot I(t), \\
				\therefore \ V_s(t) - V_c(t) = R \cdot I(t)&\ \bf{\color{blue}{(1)}} &
				\end{array}
				$$

				I.e., the current at time $t$ is proportional to the difference
				in voltages across the supply and the capacitor, the constant of proportionality being the
				resistance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now a quick aside to derive something we're going to need:
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left:200px;">
				Recall:
				$$
				I = \frac{\mathrm{d}Q(t)} {\mathrm{d}t}\ \text{ and }\ Q_c(t) = CV_c(t)
				$$

				If we differentiate $Q_c(t) = CV_c(t)$ w.r.t time, we get:

				$$
					\frac{\mathrm{d}Q_c(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = C\frac{\mathrm{d}V_c(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
				$$

				And we know that $I = \frac{\mathrm{d}Q(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}$, so we can write:

				$$
					I(t) = C\frac{\mathrm{d}V_c(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} \ \bf{\color{blue}{(2)}}
				$$

				I.e., the current at time $t$ is also proportional to change in voltage across the capacitor,
				the constant of proportionality being the capacitance.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we can continue by substituting $\bf{\color{blue}{(2)}}$ into $\bf{\color{blue}{(1)}}$ to get:

				$$
				V_s(t) - V_c(t) = R \cdot C\frac{\mathrm{d}V_c(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}
				$$

				TODO - FILL REST IN
			</p>
			<p>
				We end up with:

				$$
				V_c(t) = V_s(1 - e^{\frac{-t}{RC}})
				$$

				We can see that as the value of RC increases, the exponential value will decrease,
				which means that <b>the time it takes to charge the capacitor increases with either
				, or both of, $R$ and $C$</b>.
			</p>

			<h3>Capacitors In Series</h3>
			<p>
				$$
					\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{C_n}
				$$
			</p>
			<h3>Capacitors In Parallel</h3>
			<p>
				$$
					C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots + C_n
				$$
			</p>

			<h3>Reactance</h3>
			<p>
				See <a href="https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/C/current_lag_and_lead.html" target="_blank">Current Lead And Lag, David Darling</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The opposition to the flow of <b>alternating</b> current due to capacitance is called "capacitive reactance.".
				In capacitors, the <b>current leads voltage</b> by 90 degrees. Resistance is measure using real numbers
				but reactance is measured in the <b>complex plane</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a capacitor is uncharged, the voltage across it is zero. The increasing voltage from the AC supply
				will therefore, at the start, deliver the maximum amount of current. As the voltage across the capacitor
				grows in opposition to the supply, the current flow will decrease. Therefore at the start there must be
				minimum voltage across the capacitor, bu maximum current flow from the battery. Because the AC
				voltage is sinusoidal, this means that the current and voltage must be 90 degrees out of phase and
				the <b>current leads the voltage</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We know $V = iR$, so, of course,
				$$
				R = \frac{V}{i}
				$$
				Given the above reasoning we know that voltage across the capacitor must be a sine wave and
				therefore current must be a cosine.
				We also saw the equation for current in a section above:
				$$
					i = C\frac{\mathrm{d}V}{\mathrm{d}t}
				$$
				Therefore we can say that, if the input voltage is is $\sin(\omega t)$, then:
				$$
					i = C \omega \cos(\omega t)
				$$
				Therefore, using Ohm's law.
				$$
				R = \frac{\sin(\omega t)}{C \omega \cos(\omega t)}
				$$
				So, what's a sine divided a cosine? We can avoid some maths by recalling that multiplying
				by $j$ rotates a complex number by 90 degrees anticlockwise and how the sine and cosine can
				be seen as the values of a phasor on the imaginary and real axes respectively:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="##IMG_DIR##/sine_cosine_from_complex_axes1.png" alt="sine and cosine can be seen as the values of a phasor on the imaginary and real axes "/>
			</p>
			<p>
				So, to eliminate the sinusoids, we could express sine as a rot

				An inductor is a coil of wire, sometimes round a feris core, that <b>stores energy in its magnetic field</b>.

				Inductors <b>oppose the change of current</b> flowing though them. They are measured in &quot;Henrys&quot;.
				The formula below defines inductance, L. Inductance is the voltage generated per unit change in
				current.

				$$
				v = L \frac{\mathrm{d}i}{\mathrm{d}t}
				$$

				Integrating both sides and re-arranging we can get:

				NPN transistors consist of two N-type (negatively doped - excess electroncs) silicon &quot;chunks&quot;

				By forward biasing the emitter to base junction with even a small current, the

				A common NPN transistor is the 2N2222. Looking at the data sheet REF(`REF_2N2222', `[Ref]')
				we can find the following properties:

			<table class="jehtable">
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Max</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr><td>Collector-base voltage V<sub>CBO</sub></td><td>60 V</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Collector-emitter voltage V<sub>CEO</sub></td><td>30 V</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Emitter-base voltage V<sub>EBO</sub></td><td>5 V</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Peak collector current</td><td>800 mA</td></tr>
					<tr><td>Peak base current</td><td>200mA</td></tr>

				We can see that this device can handle a maximum of 0.8A though its emitter-collector and
				only 0.2A at the base. It is however, able to tolerate relatively high voltages, just not
				high currents, which as we said above, you'd need MOSFETs, or even relays for.

				<ul>
					<li>The <b>base is responsible for initiating transistor action</b>. When a voltage is applied at the base, it gets biased and draws <b>small current which is then used to control large</b> current at the collector and emitter side.</li>
					<li>The base action is considered as an ON-OFF valve which generates current when a proper bias voltage is applied at this terminal.</li>
					<li>The small change at the voltage applied at the base terminal shows a large impact at the output terminals. Actually, base acts as an input and collector acts as an output in NPN transistor.</li>
					<li>In case of <b>silicon transistor emitter-base junction draws voltage around 0.7</b> when there is no voltage at the base terminal, in order to initiate the electron action and put the transistor in running condition, the base voltage must be greater than 0.7 voltage in case of silicon transistor and 0.3 in case of germanium transistor.</li>

				The total resistance R<sub>A</sub> + R<sub>B</sub> will determine the time it takes
				for the transistor to charge, assuming we keep capacitance constant. However, when the capacitor
				discharges, it only discharges through R<sub>B</sub>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recall charge time for a cap to charge to 63% of the voltage across is is
				$\tau = RC$. So by varying either the resistors or the capacitor the period of the
				pulse train output on pin 3 can be varied.
			</p>
			<p>
				The diagrams above and below imagine that there is a switch inside the 555, which there is,
				its just not a mechanical switch like these diagrams suggest (see later below for more details).
				As the capacitor charges the voltage across it increases. When it hits 2/3 of the reference voltage,
				the switch in side the 555 closes such that pin 7 is shorted to ground. The capacitor then immediately
				starts to discharg through R<sub>B</sub> and when the voltage across the capacitor is less than
				1/3 the reference voltage the switch opens again, starting the charge cycle and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the switch also controls the connection between the reference voltage and the output, this
				produces a pulse train who's frequency is determined by the two resistors and the capacitor, and 
				with a duty cycle that is determined by the two resistors.

				The following is a silly little animation of the capacitor discharging through
				R2. Imagine that the 3 red dots represent the flow of electrons from the negatively
				charged plate to the positive plate of the capacitor as it discharges. I think normally it would
				be shown using conventional current flow, but this animation uses actual electron flow. meh.

				Wikimedia has a really nice illustration of the components in the 555, which I've copied below and inserted the components outside the
				chip that we used above to create an astable vibrator. Here, we can see that the switch shown above is really
				an RS flip flop combined with a transitor.

			</p>
			<p>
				Each of the components, like the RS flip flop, comparitors and other gates can be further broken down into their transitor/resitor combinations, so 
				the above is just another, slightly more detailed abstraction. The real circuit is far, far more complex when broken down into its &quot;atomic&quot;
				building blocks!
