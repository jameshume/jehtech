## Configure LUA To Use 32-bit Numbers!

See `LUA_32BITS` in file `luaconf.h`


## Command Line Options

```
% lua -i prog run chunk then interaction
```

Or use `dofile(<filename>)`


The `-e` option allows us to enter code directly into the command line, like here:
```
 % lua -e "print(math.sin(12))"
```

The `-l` option loads a library. A

## Globals
Global variables do not need declarations; we simply use them

## Conditionals
DIFFERENT FROM C-LIKE LANGUAGES:
Conditional tests (e.g., conditions in control structures) consider both the Boolean false and nil
as false and anything else as true. In particular, Lua considers both zero and the empty string as true in
conditional tests.


## Flow Control

### Ifs
```lua
if op == "+" then
    r = a + b
elseif op == "-" then
    r = a - b
else
    error("invalid operation")
end
```

### While
```lua
local i = 1
while a[i] do
    print(a[i])
    i = i + 1
end
```

### Repeat
```lua
repeat
    line = io.read()
until line ~= ""
```

### For
Numerical:

```lua
for var=start_exp,stop_exp,step_exp do
   something
end
```

Generic:

```lua
t = {10, print, x = 12, k = "hi"}
for k, v in pairs(t) do --< order that elements appear in a traversal is undefined.
   print(k, v)
end
```


## Strings

Strings in Lua are immutable values. We cannot change a character inside a string, as we can in C;

We can get the length of a string using the length operator (denoted by `#`):

```lua
 a = "hello"
 print(#a) --> 5
 print(#"good bye") --> 8
```

Concat with `..`:

```lua
> "Hello " .. "World" --> Hello World
> "result is " .. 3 --> result is 3
```

Long string literals:
```lua
longtext = [==[
            ^^
            Can add zero or more equals between brackets if we need to write a = b[c[1]], for example 
blah
blah
==]]
```

String library
`string.len(s) === #s`


## Tables
Only data structuring mechanism. They represent arrays, sets, records, and many other data structures. Just an associative array.

```lua
> a = {} -- create a table and assign its reference
> b = a -- 'b' refers to the same table as 'a'
```


Table fields evaluate to nil when not initialized.


`a.name` is syntactic sugar for `a["name"]`
### Constructing Tables
#### Tables As Lists
Indexing is 1 based not 0 based!!!

```lua
days = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}
print(days[1]) --> Sunday
```


#### Record Style (Kinda Like A Struct)

```lua
a = {x = 10, y = 20}
-- Equivalent to
-- a = {}; a.x = 10; a.y = 20
```

#### Mix List and Record Style

```lua
polyline = {color="blue",
   thickness=2,
   npoints=4,
   {x=0, y=0},   -- polyline[1]
   {x=-10, y=0}, -- polyline[2]
   {x=-10, y=1}, -- polyline[3]
   {x=0, y=1}    -- polyline[4]
}
```

#### Square Bracket Init

```lua
opnames = {["+"] = "add", ["-"] = "sub",
 ["*"] = "mul", ["/"] = "div"}

 i = 20; s = "-"
 a = {[i+0] = s, [i+1] = s..s, [i+2] = s..s..s}

 print(opnames[s]) --> sub
 print(a[22]) --> ---
```

### Traversal
Use `pairs` iterator:

```lua
t = {10, print, x = 12, k = "hi"}
for k, v in pairs(t) do --< order that elements appear in a traversal is undefined.
   print(k, v)
end
```

Or for lists use `ipairs()` to ensure traversal order.

### Table Library
Functions to operate over lists and sequences.


## Functions
```lua
function functionName(param1, param2, â€¦)
	return 1
end
```

Can call function with less params than defined with - those params are `nil`.

Functions can return multiple results:
```lua
	return 1,2,3
```

Function called as a statement - all returned results dropped
Function called as an expression - only the first result returned kept
Function is last or only expression in list of expressions - All results kept


## C API
### Object Orientism Through Prototypical Inheritance
If a variable or function does not exist in the type then lookup the thing in the metatable. 

The general pattern is this:

```c
// In this example the thing being created is a blob of user data, which is pushed onto the stack.
my_user_data = lua_newuserdatauv(L, my_user_data_size, num_user_data_slots); 
// Stack = [UD]

// Next the metatable associated with the type of thing is pushed onto the top of the stack.
luaL_getmetatable(L, "type-of-thing");
// Stack = [UD, MT]

// Duplicate the top of the stack and push it onto the stack - in this case duplicates MT.
lua_pushvalue(L, -1);
// Stack = [UD, MT, MT]

// Set MT.__index = MT. This tells Lua that if it can't find a field in the thing, look for it in the thing's metatable.
// The setfield function sets "__index" to whatever is on the top of the stack, in this case the MT. It then pops the 
// value off stack.
lua_setfield(L, -1, "__index");        
// Stack = [UD, MT]

// Associate the metatable with the thing. Set UD.__metatable = MT. Pop value off stack. 
lua_setmetatable(L, -2);                        
// Stack [UD]
```

The way lookup works is that if the member being looked up in the thing is not found, Lua looks for an associated
meta table. If it finds that it then looks it up in the meta table.

Thus by putting values and functions in the meta table, and associating it with that type, the type "inherits"
those things from the meta table.

To put functions etc in the meta table, the following pattern can be used:

```C
static const luaL_Reg METHOD_FUNCS[] = {
        {"func_name_1",  func_name_1},
        // ...
        {NULL, NULL}
};

// create metatable containing buffer object methods
luaL_newmetatable(L, "name of meta table");
// Stack = [..., MT]

// Add the functions in METHOD_FUNCS to the metatable object
luaL_setfuncs(L, METHOD_FUNCS, 0);
// Stack = [..., MT]

// Pop the MT off the stack to retore the stacks state
lua_pop(L, 1);
// Stack = [...]
```
