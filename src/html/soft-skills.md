## Tone
A very nice example on how re-wording can really change the tone of
something [from this SO thread](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/323579/am-i-being-too-snippy-or-how-should-one-treat-questions-where-op-doesnt-chec?cb=1).


Change <q>Had you looked at the error console, it would have informed you what the issue was</q>, to <q>If you look at the error console, it can tell you what the issue is</q>, really does make a super difference!


## Subtle Questions That May Or May Not Have Subtext
Hold and maintain yourself - *breath* and put on 2% of a smile to soften jaw and shoulders.

### "How hard can it be?"
Go to the asker - accept the question and address it with the road blocks you've had. For example:

> Thank you [and mean it]. Okay, so you need to know what difficulties there have been...
> There were a few blockers that made it harder than it first appeared.
> The [plumbus](https://youtu.be/SWMGd_rzRdY) seemed simple at first, but what I found was that the
> dinglebop didn't smooth out correctly using the standard process and ...
> Did that help?

The idea is to **accept and build** on the question/statemtn. Use "**yes and...**" and not a "not, but...".
Try to **view it as a gift** even if it a seamingly nasty question.

Treat it is TRACT:

* <span style="font-size: 120%;">**T**</span>hank you.
* <span style="font-size: 120%;">**R**</span>epeat.
  This gives you time to think and also allows the asker to hear how they asked the question. It can also open the
  question up to the rest of the room and prevent you getting into a 1-to-1 if in a group setting.
* <span style="font-size: 120%;">**A**</span>nswer *factually*.
* <span style="font-size: 120%;">**C**</span>heck back and clarify.
* <span style="font-size: 120%;">**T**</span>hank you.

### "You're working on something I didn't know you were working on?"
Just answer it - why are your working on it? Answer with and stick to **facts** and tread the question as a fact. The
questioner just didn't what you were working on. For example:

> Yes, you're right, you might not have known, let me explain The reason I'm working on it is that whilst
> working on my last couple pieces of work I found that it was hard to push the dinglebop through the grumbo
> and came up with this solution to do it. I think it will save us time, blah blah blah...

## Reframing
If someone uses inflammatory language, you can reframe it. For example, if someone said,

> John that useless d@$khead from Gazorpazorp didn't add the f'ing schleem to the dinglebob!

You can reframe it and repeat it back to the person.

> John didn't add the schleem to the dinglebob? 

It's a suble clue that their language is inappropriate and implicitly states how they should have said it.

However, if John was in the room at the time, this may not, however be appropriate as it could be construed by John
as allowing such language to be acceptable. If that was the case then using a model like WISH/SBI/LAP would be a
stronger choice.

## Feedback Models
Feedback tends to be in the space between nice and nasty: it's not nice, and importantly its not nasty! Its important
to note that bumps in the road of a relationship that are properly sorted out can build a stronger relationship as
participants will have the confidence that difficult things can be talked about without risking the relationship.

### OSB - Observe / Suggest / Benefit

### WISH - What / Impact / Silence / How
This model is very similar to ones like [Sitation/Behavior/Impact (SBI)](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm)
and [Action/Impact/Desired behvior (AID)](https://andiroberts.com/aid-feedback-model/).

### LAP - Listen / Agree / Pause

### Calling Out The Behaviour

### HEAT - Hear / Empathy / Ask / Take Action
