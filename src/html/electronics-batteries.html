		<h2>Chemistry Of Batteries</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Chemical Bonds</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Covelant bond (a.k.a. molecular bond): Atoms <em>share</em> electrons in their outer orbitals. Weaker bond than ionic bonds. Only form between non metals.</p>
				<p>Ionic bond: Atom &quot;donates&quot; electron(s) to its &quot;partner&quot: electron spends most of its time close to the bonded atom. Much stronger than a covelant bond. Can form between metals or nonmetals.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Battery Cells</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Battery cells use ionic solutions because the transfer of electrons between atoms can generate electric current:</p>
				<p><img src="##IMG_DIR##/electronics-battery-cell-chemistry.png" alt="Diagram of battery cell electrodes and ionic reaction causing current flow"/></p>
				<p>Once all molecules in the electrolyte have been &quot;used up&quot;, meaning there are no more molecules left
				to react with the positive electrode, the battery is depleted.</p>
				<p>Some electrolytes can be rechared by an external source connected in the opposite direction so that it essentially &quot;undoes&quot; the reaction caused during discharge.</p>
				<p>Batteries are not ideal - they have an <em>internal resistance</em>. Cells are connected in parallel to minimise this.</p>
				<p>A <em>primary cell</em> is rechargable. A <em>secondary cell</em> is not.</p>

		<h2>Battery Lifetime</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Measured in <em>amp-hours</em>. Capacity of 1 amp-hour means battery should be able to supply a current of 1 amp for an hour, 2 amps for half an hour etc. It is a unit that describes available charge of a battery (see last paragraph).
			</p>
			<p>
				Amp-hours normally specified at a given current, time or assumed 8-hours. Done because the discharge profile of a battery
				will vary with current draw. E.g. if battery has a 2 amp-hour capacity specified for a current of 2 amps, then it means
				the battery can suuply a current of 2 amps for 1 hour ( 2 amp-hour / 2 amps).
			</p>
			<p>
				Discharge profile also changes with the age of the battery, temperature and the remaining charge.
			</p>
			<p>
				As batteries discharge their internal resistance also increases. Thus, voltage of battery should
				be checked under load to get correct reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				$$
				\text{amp-hour} = \text{continuous current (amps)} * \text{discharge time (hrs)}
				$$

				Therefore, an estimate of battery life can be made if the average current draw is known:

				$$
				\text{discharge time etc. (hrs)} = \frac{\text{amp-hour}}{\text{avg continuous current (amps)}}
				$$
			</p>
			<p>
				Coulomb counters monitor the number of Coulombs (defined as $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons) seen
				coming out of a battery (or in if recharging). They rarely give the value in Coulombs. 1 amp is
				1 Coulomb per second past a point in a circuit - current is <em>speed</em> of charge flow around
				a circuit. In an hour there are 3600 seconds, so 1 amp-hour means 3600 coulombs. The counters
				will normally tell the total discharge seen so far in amp-hours or some similar unit.
