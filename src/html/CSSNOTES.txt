VIEWPORTS
=========
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts

A viewport represents the area in computer graphics being currently viewed. In web browser terms, it is generally the
same as the browser window, excluding the UI, menu bar, etc. That is, the part of the document you are viewing.



MULTI-COLUMN LAYOUT
===================
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Using_multi-column_layouts

The the CSS properties "column-count", "column-gap", "column-rule", and "column-width". Just splits out
elements into columns. As one column space gets used up the context flows into the next column and so on.

EG
	.container {
	    column-count: 3;
 	    column-gap: 20px;
 	    column-rule: 4px dotted rgb(79, 185, 227);
	}

Elements can also span *all* columns (not a subset though) using "column-span: all" property.

To stop column content breaking in awkward places use CSS Framgmentation properties. EG
"page-break-inside: avoid".
