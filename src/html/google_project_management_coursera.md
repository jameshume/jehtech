## Initiation Phase
1. **Goals**: Identify project goals
    1. Must be *clear* and *specific*.
    2. A goal must say *what* you're trying to achieve and *how* to do what's been aske, i.e. whats the KPI
    3. I.e. they are SMART - Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. 
2. **Scope**: The work that needs to happen to complete the project
3. **Deliverables**: describe tangible outputs that show stakeholders how additional revenues will be generated
    1. E.g. a report that documents the results, the product itself and so on.
    1. Help quantify and realise the impact of the project.
4. **Success criteria**: Agree on what success looks like with stakeholders.
    1. What are the measurables? 
5. **Stakeholders**: People interested in, and affected by, the completion and success of the project, Thus often instrucmental in determining the goals (mission), deliverables and success criteria for a project.
    1. "When you initiate a project you can't invest enough time in meeting your stakeholders", meet and active listen as much as possible.
    2. Must ensure their needs are understood *early* in the project.
    3. Must ensure agreement on goals and mission of project.
    4. A stakeholder analysis and power grid will help you decide how best—and how often—to communicate with team members, investors, and more.
6. **Resources**: Identify project resources: budget, people, materials.


* Cost benefit analysis: Work with stakeholders to identify
     1. What value does project create or save org
     2. How much time will be saved (customers or internal)
     3. Costs? Resources etc
     4. To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:
        1. What value will this project create? 
        2. How much money could this project save our organization? 
        3. How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
        4. How much time will it save? 
        5. How will it improve the customer experience?
     5. And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:
        1. How much time will people have to spend on this project?
        2. What are the one-time costs?
        3. Are there any ongoing costs?
        4. What about long-term costs? 
     6. Intageable benefits:
        1. Customer satisfaction - do we increase customer retention/recommedntations etc
        2. Employee satisfaction
        3. Productivity
        4. Brand perception


* Project charter
    * A document that clearly defines the project and its goals, and outlines what is needed to accomplish them,
    * May have headings
        * Project Summary
        * Goals of Project
        * Deliverables
        * Scope
            * In scope
            * Out of scope
        * Benefits and costs
    * Review with key stakeholders to move into the planning stage


* Return on Investment (ROI)
    * (G-C) / C = ROI
    * G = Financial gains
    * C = Upfront and ongoing costs
    * I.e. profit = costs * ROI
        * ROI is the percentage "gain" on investment, or "interest"


* SMART goals
    * Specific - if not specific how do you know when its complete and how long it may take
        * Ask
            * What do I want to accomplish
            * Why is this a goal? Does it have a specific reason or benefit.
            * WHo is involved, how is the recipient
            * Where should the goal be delivered?
            * Tp what degree? - REQUIREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS
    * Measureable
        * How much, how many?
        * How will I know when its accomplished?
        * METRICS
            * Benchmarks - e.g. last year's data
    * Attainable
        * A little challenging but not too extreme - set yourself up for success
        * How can it be accomplished? Break down goal into small tasks to see if it makes sense.
    * Relevant
        * Does it make sense to try and reach this goal in the context of other goals/values/needs/priorities


* OKRs - Objectives and Key Results
    * Take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome.
    * Objective describes the desired output - the goal.
        * Define what needs to be achieved
        * Describe the desired outcome
    * KRs are the measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met.
    * [Google's OKR Playbook](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/google-okr-playbook)
        > Poorly done/managed OKRs are a waste of time, an empty management gesture. Well done OKRs are a motivational management tool that helps make it clear to teams what’s important, what to optimize, and what tradeoffs to make during their day-to-day work ... Key Results are the "Hows." They: express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their constituents; must **describe outcomes, not activities**. If your KRs include words like "consult", "help", "analyze", or :participate", they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-use impact of these activities: "publish average and tail latency measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7",  rather than "assess Colossus latency:; must **include evidence of completion**. This evidence must be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of evidence include change lists, links to docs, notes, and published metrics reports.
    * [OKRs vs. KPIs](https://www.reflektive.com/blog/okrs-and-kpis-what-they-are-and-how-they-work-together/)
        * OKRs are used to reach objectives, while KPIs measure employee, departmental and organizational performance.
        * Unlike OKRs, KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) do not further the completion of a task or objective. Instead, KPIs measure the success of ongoing processes and activities.


* **SCOPE**: The boundaries of a project.
    * An agreed upon understanding as to what is included or excluded from a project
    *  The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. 
    * Helps ensure project clearly mapped out
        * Firm understanding of the project's complexity. Is it straightforward with an easily manageable list of tasks? Or will it require extensive research, multiple rounds of approvals, and a large-scale production process that will take years to complete? 
        * Scope also includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.
    * In scope == tasks included in the project plan and contribute to the project's goal.
    * Out of scope == tasks NOT included in the project plan and DONT controbiute the project's overall goal.
    * Scope creep == changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project's scope at any point after it begins
    * Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase.
    * Set up a change control process. During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
    * Triple constraint model: scope, time, cost (all effect quality). All interelated - a change in one effects the others. E.g. a change in scope may change the time and/or the cost of the project.
