<h2>Unexpected Behaviors</h2>
<div>
    <h3>Error Propagation Through Pipes</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            By default errors will not propagate through pipes, so if the latter most section of the
            pip succeeds but previous sections fail, those failures will not get trapped. Take the
            simple example script below:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">trap 'echo "ERROR"; exit 1' ERR
false | echo "latter most command in pipe"
echo "Completed without a problem"</pre>
        <p>
            If this script is run the following output is seen.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">Completed without a problem</pre>
        <p>
            Oops! To rectify the problem we must tell bash to propagate the error status through
            the pipe:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">set -o pipefail  ## Propagate error status through pipes
trap 'echo "ERROR"; exit 1' ERR
echo "Completed without a problem"
false | echo "latter most command in pipe"</pre>
        <p>
            Now the script will behave as expected and output the error message because we used
            <code>set -o pipefail</code>. When this is set <q>the return value of a pipeline is the
                status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if no command
                exited with a non-zero status</q>.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h3>ERR Trap Is Not Inherited By Shell Functions</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Sigh, this is a gotcha too! Have a look at the following test script.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">trap 'echo "ERROR"; exit 1' ERR
function test() {
    false
    echo "Function completed"
}
test
echo "Completed without a problem"</pre>
        <p>
            When the script is run, the following output is seen.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">Function completed
Completed without a problem</pre>
        <p>
            The error generated in the function has not been trapped!!
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bash man page has the following to say about shell functions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <q>When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit status of the last
                    command executed in the body.
                </q>
            </li>
            <li>
                <q>Functions are executed in the context of the current shell
                    ... [most] aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a
                    function and its caller with these exceptions: ... the ERR trap is not inherited
                    unless the -o errtrace shell option has been enabled
                </q>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So, we see both the reason and the solution. It is the combination of both points.
            Note that if the function <code>test()</code> was defined as follows that the ERR
            would be trapped.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">function test() {
    echo "Function completed"
    false
}</pre>
        <p>
            The reason that it is trapped in this case is that the return value of a shell
            function is <q>is the exit status of the last command executed</q>. The ERR is trapped
            at the main script level.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>In the original case, however, the last command was <code>echo ...</code>, so the
            function's exit code would be 0. So, no error could be trapped at the main script level.
            The trapping of the ERR has to be inherited by the function, which is not what one would
            expect. To fix this use <code>set -o errtrace</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">set -o errtrace  ## Ensure ERR is trapped in functions too
trap 'echo "ERROR"; exit 1' ERR
function test() {
        false
        echo "Function completed"
}
test
echo "Completed without a problem"</pre>
        <p>
            Now, when the script is run, the expected output is seen.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">ERROR</pre>
        <p>
            Note, that you also have to <code>exit</code> from the ERR handler, if you do not want
            to essentially ignore the error, otherwise the script
            will call the ERR handler and then continue.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>DEBUG &amp; RETURN Traps Are Not Inherited By Shell Functions</h3>
    <div>
        <p>In exactly the same way as ERR is not inherited by shell functions neither are
            the DEBUG and RETURN traps. To allow these to be inherited use <code>set -o functrace</code>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>



<h2>A Generic Error Handler With Stack Trace</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Bash has some magic array variables, <code>FUNCNAME</code>, <code>BASH_LINENO</code> and
        <code>BASH_SOURCE</code> as well as a builtin function <code>caller</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The builtin <code>caller</code> provides the easiest way to create a stack trace.
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">function testA() {
    caller
    echo "--------"
    i=0; while caller $i; do (( i=i+1 )); done
}

function testB() {
    testA
}

function testC() {
    testB
}

testC</pre>
    <p>
        The output of this script is:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">8 ./test6.sh
--------
8 testB ./test6.sh
12 testC ./test6.sh
15 main ./test6.sh</pre>
    <p>
        Its not a pretty stack trace, but it is a stack trace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets put this into a trap handler:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">function err_handler() {
    echo -e "\\n-----------------------------------------"
    echo "An error occurred with status $1"
    echo "Stack trace is:"
    i=0; while caller $i; do (( i=i+1 )); done
}
trap "err_handler $?" ERR
set -o pipefail
set -o errtrace

false

function a1() {
    false
}

function a2() {
    a1
}

a2</pre>
    <p>
        The error handler deliberately does not <code>exit</code> so that we can see how all the
        errors are processed. The output of the script is as follows, annotated with linux style
        comments:
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums">-----------------------------------------
An error occurred with status 0
Stack trace is:
11 main test6.sh    #&lt: This is the false before the function definitions

-----------------------------------------
An error occurred with status 0
Stack trace is:
14 a1 test6.sh      #&lt: This is the fail from the function chain main -&gt; a2 -&gt; a1
18 a2 test6.sh
21 main test6.sh

-----------------------------------------
An error occurred with status 0
Stack trace is:
18 a2 test6.sh      #&lt: This is _interesting_! The error handler in a2 has trapped the
21 main test6.sh    #&lt: error generated by a1... this could execute because the handler
                    #&lt: did not exit()
-----------------------------------------
An error occurred with status 0
Stack trace is:
21 main test6.sh    #&lt: This is _interesting_! The error handler main has trapped the
21 main test6.sh    #&lt: error generated by a2... this could execute because the handler
                    #&lt: did not exit()</pre>
    <p>
        Yay! We have an ERR trap handler that prints out a stack trace. Wonderful! We could
        make the stack trace prettier either by parsing the <code>caller</code> output or
        by using the builtin Bash variables mentioned above.
