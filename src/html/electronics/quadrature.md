Two signals are in quadrature if:

* They have the same frequency
* They differ in phase by exactly 90 degrees

Example:

$$
\begin{align}
    I(t) &= \cos(2\omega t) \\
    Q(t) &= \sin(2\omega t)
\end{align}
$$

These are quadrature signals.

The signals are **orthogonal**, i.e., they do not interfere with eachother which, for example, allows two independent signals to share the same carrier frequency - very useful!

I think of the orthogonality of the signals in the same way I was taught orthogonality for vectors (see [linear algrebra notes on orthogonality and indpendence](../mathsy_stuff/linear_alg.html#orthogonal_linear_independence)).
