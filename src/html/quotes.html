		<h2>Happiness</h2>
		<p><i>-- Ricky Gervais' After Life</i>
		</p><p>
			Happiness is amazing. It's so amazing, it doesn't matter if it's yours or not. There's that lovely thing: "A society grows great when old men plant trees, the shade of which they know they will never sit in". Good people do things for other people. That's it. The end. 
		</p>

		<h2>Do your best in all you do</h2>
		<p><i>-- Martin Luther King Jr.</i>
		</p><p>
		If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even
		as a Michaelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare 
		wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven
		and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did 
		his job well'.
		</p>

		<h2>Cultivating love</h2>
		<p><i>-- Brené Brown</i>
		</p><p>
		We cultivate love when we allow our most vulnerable and powerful selves to 
		be deeply seen and known, and when we honor the spiritual connection that 
		grows from that offering with trust, respect, kindness and affection.
		</p><p>
		Love is not something we give or get; it is something that we nurture and 
		grow, a connection that can only be cultivated between two people when it 
		exists within each one of them – we can only love others as much as we 
		love ourselves.
		</p><p>
		Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection 
		damage the roots from which love grows. Love can only survive these 
		injuries if they are acknowledged, healed and rare.
		</p><p>

		<h2>It's not the critic who counts</h2>
		<p><i> -- Theodore RooseveltI</i>
		</p><p>
		It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong 
		man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The
		credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is 
		marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who
		comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and
		shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great 
		enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
		who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who 
		at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that 
		his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know 
		victory nor defeat. 
		</p>

		<h2>Why I deserve compassion</h2>
		<p><i>-- Steve Dolphy</i>
		</p><p>
		I find myself in the position of any human being who has ever lived, is 
		alive today, or will be alive in the future. I have been given the gift 
		of life, one life, and I will spend my whole life trying to understand it, 
		trying to work out what to do with it, trying to find my way through it.
		</p><p>
		For this I deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		I did not ask to be given this life, but it is the one, the only one, I 
		have been given. There is no chance for a refund, a part-exchange, or an upgrade. This is it.
		</p><p>
		For this I deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		I did not choose the family I was born into. I did not make a choice to 
		choose the wisest, most able, richest, most loving parents, living in the 
		most beautiful house, in the most beautiful part of the world. I was 
		given the parents I have got, who gave me the start in life that I had. 
		They did not choose me either, but I am who they got.
		</p><p>
		For this I, and they, deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		I did not choose the body I was born into. My body is the result of two 
		hundred thousand years of human evolution and is an amazing and wondrous 
		machine. But it is still a machine that has weaknesses. When I was born 
		my body was not fully grown and ready to go. I had to spend many years 
		in the early parts of my life with a body that was not yet fully strong 
		and healthy. Yet my body still had to deal with all that Life threw at it.
		</p><p>
		For this I deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		I did not choose the mind I was born with. Evolution created the 
		marvelous and extraordinary thing that is the human mind. But the mind 
		has its limitations. When I was born my mind was not fully developed and 
		fully aware. I had to spend many years in the early parts of my life with 
		a mind that was not yet fully developed. There were so many things I had 
		to learn, remember and understand (believing that all I read, was told, 
		or heard was true) and in this immature state my mind still had to deal 
		with all the problems and difficulties that Life presented.
		</p><p>
		For this I deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		In the middle years of my life when my adult body is at its physical peak 
		it will still have its vulnerabilities and it will still have to deal with
		all the things that Life brings. In these middle years, when mentally I am
		at my best, I will still, on a week-to-week, day-to-day, moment-to-moment 
		basis, be taking many decisions and making many choices on the basis of 
		incomplete or imperfect information. Sometimes I will make mistakes. 
		Sometimes I won’t make the best of choices.
		</p><p>
		For this I deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		In the later years of my life when my aging body and mind are in decline, 
		I will not only be facing Life’s challenges, but will also have the task 
		of dealing with what Life serves up to me, with a mind and body that 
		are past their peak. Sometimes there will be things I am no longer able 
		to do well, even do at all, for myself or those I love.
		</p><p>
		For this I deserve compassion.
		</p><p>
		And on the last day I am alive, when I look back at the things I have 
		done with my life, my mind will find, amongst the things that I am pleased 
		with or proud of, those choices I wish I had not made, those things 
		I wish I had, or had not done. And when I find myself in that position 
		I should remind myself of those times, however rare, when I made the 
		bravest, most difficult and wisest of choices. Those moments when I said 
		to myself: &quot;I deserve compassion.&quot;

		Knowledge builds on itself; it is governed by the rule of compounding. The key is to
