## Intro

* Main ARM series: R for **R**eal-time processors, A for **A**pplication processors, M for **M**icrocontroller processors.
    * Pipelines: A has long, R long/medium, M short.
    * M is ultra low power and deterministic.
        * MPU, NVIC, Wakeup Interrup Contrller WIC, ARM TrustZone security extensions.
        * Cortex-M0(+) - Smallest most energy efficient processors. M0+ has vector relocation feature and single cycle I/O interface.
            * Cortext-M23 - Similar to M0+. Better engergy efficiency and supports TrustZone extension.
            * Uses the ARM-v6-M architecture.
        * Cortex-M4 - Small but powerful for low-power ucontrollers. Has hardware divider and MAC instructions. Debug and trace features. DSP. SIMD instruction. Option hardware single precision float support. Uses ARM-v7-M architecture.
        * Cortext-M7 - High performance. Supports double precision floating point standard. Cache and TCM.
        * Instructions sets
            * 32-bit ARM
            * 16-bit Thumb. Introducedin 1995 as 32-bit instructions took more space and power. Both 16-bit and 32-bit instructions sets supported. 16-bit had oood code density. Supporting both impacted performance.
            * 16-bit and 32-bit Thumb-2
                * Introduced in 2003. Keeps the code density of the Thumb instruction set and the performance of the 32-bit set. Most processors now only support the Thumb-2 instruction set (>= M0).

* CortexM's all use Thumb-2 instruction set.
    * NO ARM instruction set support
    * No Coprocessor 15: The coprocessor was used to configure the main processor. Cortex-M devices do not have this. Instead all the registers are memory-mapped to reserved regions of memory.
    * Vector table is a set of addresses, *not* instructions.
        * Typical ARM vector tables would be a table of jump instructions.
* Cortex-M23/M33 : ARMv8.
* Cortex-M3      : ARMv7-M, 3-stage pipeline.
    * Mosty 32-bit instructions
* Cortex-M7      : ARMv7-M, 6 stage pipeline.
    * Mosty 32-bit instructions
* Cortex-M0+     : Less than 12k gates (what the M0 "should have been").
    * ARM-v6-M architecture (16-bit Thumb, except system instructions). Majority 16-bit instructions, some 32-bit instructions like `BL`, for example.
    * 2-stage pipeline (M0 has 3-stage)
    * Optional User/priviledged support
    * Optional MPU with 8 regions.
    * AHB-Lite master interface
    * Optional low-latency I/O port. Read and writes are done in a *single cycle*. Address and data in one cycle. All other ARM protocols use a minimum of two cycles. Typically used for GPIO operations.
    * Optional support for a WIC controller for increased power saving.
* Cortex-M0/M0+  : Designed for LOW POWER.
    * Majority 16-bit instructions, some 32-bit instructions like `BL`, for example.
    * M0's are aimed at replacing PICs in the market place.
    * No hardware divide.
    * Hardware multiplier is optional.
    * M0+ only: uTrace: use internal SRAM as a trace buffer - record the execution of the program into the trace buffer and then use debugger to access buffer.
    * Von-Neumann architecture (Other Cortex-Ms use Harvard achitecture.)
* Cortex-M chips use Thumb-2 instruction set *only*.
* v6-M --> V7-M : ~50 instructtions --> ~200 instructions - sizeable increase.
* M4 is like an M3 with instructions for DSP - SIMD and a single-precision FPU optionally. Some operator improvement for efficiency.

## Programmers Model
* Explains the interface programmer must use to design their application on a specific processor.

* Registers:
  * General Pupose
    * R0-R7: Accessible to all instrunctions
    * R8-R12: Accessible to a few 16-bit instructions and all 32-bit instuctions
  * R13 is *Stack Pointer* (SP)
    * Armv7-M cores have two banked versions. There are two stack pointers.
      * Don't have to use both but can choose to use both.
      * MSP - Main Stack (R13) (Out of reset MSP is active)
      * PSP - Process Stack (priviledged)
    * Points to the last entry in the stack, going down in the address range.
    * R13 is an alias for the *currently active* stack. So if MSP is currently activated, R13 references the MSP, but if PSP is activated then R13 references the PSP. To activate one or the other, use the CONTROL register.
  * R14 is the *Link Register* (LR)
    * Enables return from subroutines
    * Special function for exception handling
  * R15 is the *Program Counter* (PC): Points to the address of the code being **fetched** from memory at this moment.
    * When jumping +1 to address when executing Thumb-2 instructions (e.g. accessing 0x1000 warite 0x1001 to PC) - its a wierd ARM thing - because ARM has hijacked bit 0 of the instruction address bus internally within the core (externally always see addredd 0x1000) and used as a way to configure the execution state of the processor. Decides which instruction set the instruction belongs to - 32-bit ARM instructions or 16-bit Thumb-2 sintructions. Bit 0 of instruction address bus is connected to T-bit of the state control register - it tells the core what type of instruction it is decoding.
      > The CPSR register holds the processor mode (user or exception flag), interrupt mask bits, condition codes, and Thumb status bit. The Thumb status bit indicates the processorâ€™s current state: 0 for ARM state (default) or 1 for Thumb. -- https://www.embedded.com/introduction-to-arm-thumb
    * Its of no use for Cortex-M processors as they only have Thumb-2, but, still need to jump with +1 on the address! Hey ho!
    * And then... M33 then the T-bit apparently has another meaning so gets more complicated?
  * Speical purpose
      * Processor status (xPSR) - Combined Program Status Register - contains, in one register, the following 3 "registers":
            * Indicate the state of the core right now.
            * APSR - Application Program Status Register - Only APSR flags can be uysed for confition execution (`BCC, `IT`).

      * CONTROL: Stacks and privilege.
      * PRIMASK (only Arm-v7), FAULTMASK (only Arm-v7), BASEPRI: Exception handling.
          * PRIMASK is a 1 bit register that when set blocks all interrupts other than the NMI and hard fault.
      * In unprivileged mode all special registers are read only except for the APSR. The EPSR is not accessible (reads zero) in all modes.  IPSR is always RO.


## Architecture
An *architecture* defines <q>how the program execution should behave and how the debuggers interact with the processor</q>.

A *micro-architecture* defines <q>the exact implementation details of the processor, e.g. how many pipeline stages ... etc</q>.

* Modes, privilege and stacks
  * Handler Mode
    * Entered when taking any exception.
    * Always privileged.
    * Always uses main stack.
    * OS can run here.
    * Handles exceptions.
    * Processor returns to thread mode once exception processing finished.
    * Always priviledged.
  * Thread mode
    * Execute applications.
    * Processor enters thread mode (priviledged) at startup.
    * CONTROL register controls whether executions is privileged or un privileged.
    * Core enters thread mode out of reset.
    * Typically used for user app code.
    * Runs either priviliedged or unpriviliedged (should be configured by the reset handler).
    * Can use either main or process stack.
    * Typically uses process stack if Thread mode is unpriviledged.
    * User "apps" can run here.
    * On reset processor runs in thread mode.

  | Handler  | Interrupt handlers & OS code - MSP (R13) - Can*not* use PSP!  | Not allowed                                      |
  | Thread   | Any code - MSP (R13) *or* PSP (but not usually)               | Any code - MSP (R13) *or* PSP (but not usually)  |
  
  + If we use PSP it is because we want to use it in user mode. MSP is meant to be used by an operating system. On a simple system that does not have such a separation it would probably just use the MSP.

* Priviledge levels:
    * Unprivileged:
        * Limited access to MSR (move general register to program status register (PSR)) and MRS (copy PSR to general register) instructions.
        * Cannot use change-process-state (CPS) instruction.
        * Cannot access sys timer, NVIC, or system control block.
        * Restricted access to peripherals.
        * Must use SVC instruction to make supervisor call to transfer priviledge levels.
    * Privileged:
        * Can use all instrutions and resources.
        * Can write to CONTROL register to change privilege level.
        * Out of reset you are in privileged mode.

* Interrupts and Exceptions
    * Optimized for low latency and good interrupt performance.
        * Auto save and restore of processor registers.
        * Implements all ARMv7-M low latency features - this is available on the M0(+) devices too.
            * Late arrival, tail-chaining, lazy FPU stacking, ICI bits for load/store multiple operations.
        * Aggressive fliushing of multi-cycle operations in pipeline.
            * To enable interrupt processing to start quickly.
            * Applies to all DEV/SO loads/stores that have bit vee started on the bus.
        * Avoids bursts on the bus for DEV/SO load/store multiples - may reduce bus performance.
    * Core includes Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).
    * Interrupt latency:
        * Typically 12 cycles.
        * 15+ cycles for M0.
  
* Power Management
    * Mostly SoC dependant.
    * Sleep modes:
        * SLEEPING.
        * DEEPSLEEP.
            * Controlled by system control reigsters.
            * Is software programmable (just states an intention - the job to actually go deep sleep is left to the SoC implementor to do).
        * WIC-based DEEPSLEEP.
        * 2 outputs: 1 to say "I am sleeping" and 1 to say "I am DEEP sleeping" so the SoC can see its state.
    * WFI, WFE and SEV instructions (wait fo rinterrupt/event and send event).
        * If you execute these the core goes into standby state an asserts the sleep signals so the SoC can see its state.
    * Sleep On Exit.
        * Sleep immediately on return from last ISR.
    * System clock is gated in sleep modes.
        * Sleep signal is exported allowing external systemn to be block gated.
        * NVIC interrupt interface stays awake.
    * Wake-Up Interrupt Controller (WIC).
        * Optional external wak-up detector allows core to be fully powered down.
        * Effecting with State-Retention Power Gating (SRPG) methodology.
