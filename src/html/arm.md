## Intro

* Main ARM series: R for **R**eal-time processors, A for **A**pplication processors, M for **M**icrocontroller processors.
    * Pipelines: A has long, R long/medium, M short.
    * M is ultra low power and deterministic.
        * MPU, NVIC, Wakeup Interrup Contrller WIC, ARM TrustZone security extensions.
        * Cortex-M0(+) - Smallest most energy efficient processors. M0+ has vector relocation feature and single cycle I/O interface.
            * Cortext-M23 - Similar to M0+. Better engergy efficiency and supports TrustZone extension.
            * Uses the ARM-v6-M architecture.
        * Cortex-M4 - Small but powerful for low-power ucontrollers. Has hardware divider and MAC instructions. Debug and trace features. DSP. SIMD instruction. Option hardware single precision float support. Uses ARM-v7-M architecture.
        * Cortext-M7 - High performance. Supports double precision floating point standard. Cache and TCM.
        * Instructions sets
            * 32-bit ARM
            * 16-bit Thumb. Introducedin 1995 as 32-bit instructions took more space and power. Both 16-bit and 32-bit instructions sets supported. 16-bit had oood code density. Supporting both impacted performance.
            * 16-bit and 32-bit Thumb-2
                * Introduced in 2003. Keeps the code density of the Thumb instruction set and the performance of the 32-bit set. Most processors now only support the Thumb-2 instruction set (>= M0).

* CortexM's all use Thumb-2 instruction set.
    * NO ARM instruction set support
    * No Coprocessor 15: The coprocessor was used to configure the main processor. Cortex-M devices do not have this. Instead all the registers are memory-mapped to reserved regions of memory.
    * Vector table is a set of addresses, *not* instructions.
        * Typical ARM vector tables would be a table of jump instructions.
* Cortex-M23/M33 : ARMv8.
* Cortex-M3      : ARMv7-M, 3-stage pipeline.
    * Mosty 32-bit instructions
* Cortex-M7      : ARMv7-M, 6 stage pipeline.
    * Mosty 32-bit instructions
* Cortex-M0+     : Less than 12k gates (what the M0 "should have been").
    * ARM-v6-M architecture (16-bit Thumb, except system instructions). Majority 16-bit instructions, some 32-bit instructions like `BL`, for example.
    * 2-stage pipeline (M0 has 3-stage)
    * Optional User/priviledged support
    * Optional MPU with 8 regions.
    * AHB-Lite master interface
    * Optional low-latency I/O port. Read and writes are done in a *single cycle*. Address and data in one cycle. All other ARM protocols use a minimum of two cycles. Typically used for GPIO operations.
    * Optional support for a WIC controller for increased power saving.
* Cortex-M0/M0+  : Designed for LOW POWER.
    * Majority 16-bit instructions, some 32-bit instructions like `BL`, for example.
    * M0's are aimed at replacing PICs in the market place.
    * No hardware divide.
    * Hardware multiplier is optional.
    * M0+ only: uTrace: use internal SRAM as a trace buffer - record the execution of the program into the trace buffer and then use debugger to access buffer.
    * Von-Neumann architecture (Other Cortex-Ms use Harvard achitecture.)
* Cortex-M chips use Thumb-2 instruction set *only*.
* v6-M --> V7-M : ~50 instructtions --> ~200 instructions - sizeable increase.
* M4 is like an M3 with instructions for DSP - SIMD and a single-precision FPU optionally. Some operator improvement for efficiency.
* No instruction cache (except M7)

## Programmers Model
* Explains the interface programmer must use to design their application on a specific processor.
* Registers:
    * General Pupose
        * R0-R7: Accessible to all instrunctions
        * R8-R12: Accessible to a few 16-bit instructions and all 32-bit instuctions
    * R13 is *Stack Pointer* (SP)
        * Armv7-M cores have two banked versions. There are two stack pointers.
            * Don't have to use both but can choose to use both.
            * MSP - Main Stack (R13) (Out of reset MSP is active)
            * PSP - Process Stack (priviledged)
        * Points to the last entry in the stack, going down in the address range.
        * R13 is an alias for the *currently active* stack. So if MSP is currently activated, R13 references the MSP, but if PSP is activated then R13 references the PSP. To activate one or the other, use the CONTROL register.
      * Stack pointer **must be 8 or 4 byte aligned**. I.e. can only stack words or double words. But when you **call** a function the SP should be **8 byte aligned**!
      * SP points to the top of the stack.
      * Stack **grows downwards (full descending)**, i.e. the bottom of the stack is at address X and the top of the stack is at address X - STACK_SIZE. So, grows downwards means grows into lower/smaller address values as items are pushed.
          * E.g. If SRAM is 0x2000_0000 to 0x2000_7FFF then at start SP is 0x2000_8000, so that the first push will be to 0x2000_7FFC (remember SP must be at least word aligned).
      * Passing parameters by stack is inefficient (if more that 4 parameters to a function). Accessing stack memory, because most Cortex-M have no cache, involves memory access - costly in time and power consumption as outside bus is used.
            * If at all possible on your architecture, cache the stack memory!
    * R14 is the *Link Register* (LR)
        * Enables return from subroutines
        * Special function for exception handling
    * R15 is the *Program Counter* (PC): Points to the address of the code being **fetched** from memory at this moment.
        * When jumping +1 to address when executing Thumb-2 instructions (e.g. accessing 0x1000 warite 0x1001 to PC) - its a wierd ARM thing - because ARM has hijacked bit 0 of the instruction address bus internally within the core (externally always see addredd 0x1000) and used as a way to configure the execution state of the processor. Decides which instruction set the instruction belongs to - 32-bit ARM instructions or 16-bit Thumb-2 sintructions. Bit 0 of instruction address bus is connected to T-bit of the state control register - it tells the core what type of instruction it is decoding.
            > The CPSR register holds the processor mode (user or exception flag), interrupt mask bits, condition codes, and Thumb status bit. The Thumb status bit indicates the processorâ€™s current state: 0 for ARM state (default) or 1 for Thumb. -- https://www.embedded.com/introduction-to-arm-thumb
        * Its of no use for Cortex-M processors as they only have Thumb-2, but, still need to jump with +1 on the address! Hey ho!
        * And then... M33 then the T-bit apparently has another meaning so gets more complicated?
    * Special purpose
        * Processor status (xPSR) - Combined Program Status Register - contains, in one register, the following 3 "registers":
              * Indicate the state of the core right now.
              
              * APSR - Application Program Status Register - Only APSR flags can be used for condition execution (`BCC`, `IT`). In original ARM instruction set almost all instructions could be issued conditionally based on contents of APSR, but in Thumb-2 conditional execution is only supported using 16-bit branch instructions `B<c> addr`.

## Architecture
An *architecture* defines <q>how the program execution should behave and how the debuggers interact with the processor</q>.

A *micro-architecture* defines <q>the exact implementation details of the processor, e.g. how many pipeline stages ... etc</q>.

* Modes, privilege and stacks
    * Handler Mode
        * Entered when taking any exception.
        * Always privileged.
        * Always uses main stack.
        * OS can run here.
        * Handles exceptions.
        * Processor returns to thread mode once exception processing finished.
        * Always priviledged.
    * Thread mode
        * Execute applications.
        * Processor enters thread mode (priviledged) at startup.
        * CONTROL register controls whether executions is privileged or un privileged.
        * Core enters thread mode out of reset.
        * Typically used for user app code.
        * Runs either priviliedged or unpriviliedged (should be configured by the reset handler).
        * Can use either main or process stack.
        * Typically uses process stack if Thread mode is unpriviledged.
        * User "apps" can run here.
        * On reset processor runs in thread mode.

![State transistion for privilege and stack pointer selection](##IMG_DIR##/arm_sp_selection_and_priv_state_selection.png)
  
  + If we use PSP it is because we want to use it in user mode. MSP is meant to be used by an operating system. On a simple system that does not have such a separation it would probably just use the MSP.

* Priviledge levels:
    * Unprivileged:
        * Limited access to MSR (move general register to program status register (PSR)) and MRS (copy PSR to general register) instructions.
        * Cannot use change-process-state (CPS) instruction.
        * Cannot access sys timer, NVIC, or system control block.
        * Restricted access to peripherals.
        * Must use SVC instruction to make supervisor call to transfer priviledge levels.
    * Privileged:
        * Can use all instrutions and resources.
        * Can write to CONTROL register to change privilege level.
        * Out of reset you are in privileged mode.

* Interrupts and Exceptions
    * Optimized for low latency and good interrupt performance.
        * Auto save and restore of processor registers.
        * Implements all ARMv7-M low latency features - this is available on the M0(+) devices too.
            * Late arrival, tail-chaining, lazy FPU stacking, ICI bits for load/store multiple operations.
        * Aggressive flushing of multi-cycle operations in pipeline.
            * To enable interrupt processing to start quickly.
            * Applies to all DEV/SO loads/stores that have bit vee started on the bus.
        * Avoids bursts on the bus for DEV/SO load/store multiples - may reduce bus performance.
    * Core includes Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).
    * Interrupt latency:
        * Typically 12 cycles.
        * 15+ cycles for M0.
  
* Power Management
    * Mostly SoC dependant.
    * Sleep modes:
        * SLEEPING.
        * DEEPSLEEP.
            * Controlled by system control reigsters.
            * Is software programmable (just states an intention - the job to actually go deep sleep is left to the SoC implementor to do).

## Instruction Set
* WARNING: `nop` not guaranteed to waste a cycle!!!! use `mv r0, r0` instead.
TODO
* Sync
    * WARNING DMB only works for one bus - 2 load/stores on 2 different busses do not have order of execution segregated by DMB as it only focuses on one bus and does not work across busses.
    * DSB is stricter than DMB - not just load/stores but intructions too - no futher instructions may complete execution or change interrupt masks until the Memory Barrier instruction completes. Including *implicit* operations - e.g. a cache controller refreshing its contents etc. Applies to *multiple* busses and *broadcasts to other cores in the cluster*.

### Stack

The ARM stack is <b>fully descending</b>. Descending means that it starts at a high address and each push <b>decrements</b> the stack pointer.

In a Full stack, <b>the stack pointer points to the topmost item in the stack, i.e.,the last item pushed into it</b>.
When pushing data into a Full stack, the stack pointer is first adjusted to reflect its new location and then
the data is stored in the stack at the address in the stack pointer.

The stack pointer must normally be 4-byte aligned, except at a "public interface", when it should be 8 byte, or double-word, aligned.
A "public interface" consists of any externally accessible functions offered by a library or component. I.e., when
enterying _any_ function, the stack should always start off 8-byte aligned.

The stack frame is described in Figure B1-3 of the ArmV7 Exception Model like so (when no FP registers saved):

## Exceptions / Interrupts
### References
* [PendSV+SVC on Cortex M](https://jeelabs.org/202x/jeeh/pendsvc/)

### NVIC Enabled Interrupt
The interrupts are grouped in groups of 32, where `NVIC_ISER[0]` is for vectors numbered 0 through 31, `NVIC_ISER[1]` 32 through 63, and so on. In the the vendor's CMSIS package,
there is likely the type `IRQn_Type`. The vectors 0 and above, map directly to the `NVIC_ISRx` register.

### Stacking
Stacking is done by the Cortex-M for you and involves saving the current state of the processor so that the interrupted program can be resumed after the interrupt is serviced. 

* Uses the *fore ground* stack, which can be either the MSP or PSP, to save the pre-interrupt state of the CPU (unless the exception is a tail-chained or a late arriving exception).
    * Uses a micro-coded entry/exit mechanism whereby the the hardware itself will do things like save the processor context etc. Thus, when
      your ISR code executes, the state of the task executing just before the exception has already been saved to the active stack. Makes
      interrupt handling simpler.
* Reads ISR address from vector table.
* Link register modified for interrupt return.
* First instruction of ISR executed. (approx. 11 - 12 cycles delay for this to happen).
    * It is executed in *handler* mode using the *main* stack pointer.

#### Cortex M0
[[See ARM doc]](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0419/c/System-Level-Architecture/System-Level-Programmers--Model/ARMv6-M-exception-model/Exception-entry-behavior?lang=en):

TODO/FIXME - formatting is broken!

1. If the program being interrupted is *not* an interrupt and the PSP is being used, use the PSP, otherwise use the MSP.
   In other words, the *PSP is only used when interrupting a thread-mode program already using the PSP*.

2. Push onto selected stack, in the following order: `R0`-`R3`, `R12`, `LR`, return-address, `xPSR`. The return address depends on the exception type: 
    * NMI - address of the next instruction to be executed.
    * HardFault (precise) - the address of the instruction causing fault.
    * HardFault (imprecise) - address of the next instruction to be executed.
    * SVC - address of next instruction after SVC.
    * IRQ - address of next instruction after interrupt.

3. Set the LR to special magic value that is intercepted on exception exit. 

    * If the program being interrupted is an interrupt: `LR = 0xFFFFFFF1`: Return to Handler Mode. Exception return gets state from the Main stack. On return execution uses the Main Stack.
    
    * Else if the MSP is being used by the thread mode program:

        * `LR = 0xFFFFFFF9`: Return to Thread Mode. Exception return gets state from the Main stack. On return execution uses the Main Stack.
        * Else `LR = 0xFFFFFFFFD`: Return to Thread Mode. Exception return gets state from the Process stack. On return execution uses the Process Stack.

4. Prepare to jump to service handler
    * Change current mode to handler mode
    * Change stack to MSP
    * Get address of service handler based on exception number
    * Jump to exception handler.

![Example of interrupt handler pushing values to PSP and switching to MSP](##IMG_DIR##/arm_example_interrupt_psp_to_msp_switch.png)

### Unstacking
Unstacking is the opposite of stacking and occurs when the last interrupt service routine returns. It restores the state of the
interrupted program and resumes it, or possibly instead puts the processor to sleep.

## Stack Unwinding
### Why Are Frame Pointers "Deprecated"
In a word inefficiency - waste a register and have to push/pop that register on every function call, when a function call doesn't need it... it knows what it did to the stack so can undo it on a return. Only needed the FP for stack unwinding, which is relatively rare. Hence the move to exception handling tables. [[Ref]](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/unwinding-stack-frame-pointers-and-orc).

<q>According to an analysis by Mel Gorman, using frame pointers added overhead of up to 5-10% in some memory management related benchmarks.</q> [[Ref]](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/unwinding-stack-frame-pointers-and-orc).

### PREL31
* TLDR; It's just a 31-bit signed offset relative to a location.
* `PREL31` stands for "Positive RELative 31-bit," which describes a specific way of encoding relative offsets. It is used in ARM architecture to represent a 31-bit signed relative offset to a target address
    * Can be used to allow Position Independent Code (PIC): the program code to run from any memory address, as it uses offsets   relative to the program counter rather than absolute addresses.
    * Also used for static linking: <q>Relocation information is used by linkers in order to bind symbols and addresses that could not be determined when the initial object was generated.</q>
        * When a linker encounters an R_ARM_PREL31 relocation, it needs to modify the instruction to include a relative offset to the target symbol. This offset is calculated based on the address of the instruction itself and the address of the target symbol.
        * Uses:
            * Could be for function calls to functions located a fixed offset relative to the current instruction.
            * Could be for data that is located at a fixed offset relative to the current instruction.

* From [aaelf32](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/aaelf32/aaelf32.rst#561relocation-codes), the definition of
  the encoding is `PREL31 = (((S + A) | T) - P) & 0x7FFFFFFF`, where
     * `S` = Address of symbol
     * `A` = Addend for relocation
     * `P` = Address of place being relocated to
     * `T` = `1` if `S` is a function and the Thumb instruction set is being used, `0` otherwise.
     * For example, when modifying an instruction with a PREL31 offset, `P` is the instructions address and `S` is the symbol being referenced, and I guess `A` is `0`. From the PREL31 value, the offset is calculated and the instruction's immediate value is set to hold this offset.
        * Lets say the instruction is at `0x1500` and the function is at `0x2000`. From the above we calculate `((0x2000 + 0x0) - 0x1500) & 0x7FFFFFFF` to get `0xB00`.
        * Lets say the instruction is at `0x2000` and the function is at `0x1500`. From the above we calculate `((0x1500 + 0x0) - 0x2000) & 0x7FFFFFFF` to get `0x7FFFF000`, which because this is a signed 31-bit number, is `-2816`, or -`0xB00`.

To understand this better, especially the `addend`, which confused me a little, one has to look at relocations.

The article [Relocations: Fantastic Symbols But Where To Find Them](https://gotplt.org/posts/relocations-fantastic-symbols-but-where-to-find-them.html) is
a really great (bloody amazing) read with many good references available within.

So why an "addend"? For example, an addend might be required to compensate for PC bias. If a jump or symbol address is PC relative, an addend must be used because the PC
will be ahead of the currently executing instruction, but the offset is relative to the currently executing instruction. Therefore the addend
would subtract X bytes to use the PC as it was the the instruction to which the offset refers:

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Relocation information is used by linkers in order to bind symbols and addresses that could not be determined when the initial object was generated ...
    </p><p>
        A binary file may use REL or RELA relocations or a mixture of the two ... If the relocation is pc-relative then 
        <b>compensation for the PC bias</b> (the PC value is 8 bytes ahead of the executing instruction in Arm state and 
        4 bytes in Thumb state) must be encoded in the relocation by the object producer.
    </p>
    <footer>-- <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/aaelf32/aaelf32.rst#addends-and-pc-bias-compensation" target="_blank">ELF for the Arm(R) Architecture</a>.</footer>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
In the unwind code, even in GCCs own code, **the `addend` for PREL31 encoding appears to be assumed to be zero**.

### Exception Index Table & Handling Table

#### Exception Index Table
<q>Exception-handling table entries have a variable size. A handling table entry is found by searching a table of index entries. To support binary search, the index table must consist of contiguous fixed-size entries, each of which identifies a function start address, with the entries ordered by increasing function start address</q> -- [EHABI32](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/ehabi32/ehabi32.rst#the-exception-handling-table).

#### Exception Handling Table (EHT)

<q>The exception-handling table (EHT) contains one entry for each non-leaf function that may need to be unwound ... A table entry has a variable size. It encodes ... the actions required to propagate an exception through the function ... How to unwind a stack frame associated with the function ... In some usefully common cases, a handling table entry contains so little information that itâ€™s content can be packed directly into the index table entry</q>  -- [EHABI32](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/ehabi32/ehabi32.rst#the-exception-handling-table).

The format of the entries is shown in the image below.

![Arm exception index table and exception handling table overview](##IMG_DIR##/arm_exidx.png)

#### Unwinding The Stack
Unwinding the stack is done in two phases:

1. The stack is virtually unwound looking for a propagation barrier.
2. The stack is really unwound and cleanups are run

A **virtual register set** is a buffer area used to hold copied of the real machine registers and other relevant machine state so that, for example, the first phase can search for a propogation barrier without actually modifying the real machine state. It is used in stack unwinding as an abstraction of the processor's register state during an exception and plays a critical role in decoding, simulating, and restoring the state of the processor during stack unwinding.

... TODO - the rest ... I don't have to look at this any longer so leaving it here for now ...

* [FreeRTOS `port.c` Source Code For Cortext-M0](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/GCC/ARM_CM0/port.c)

### PendSV
PendSV is generally used for context switching because, unlike the SVC exception, which is synchronous (happens as soon as the SVC instruction is encountered), the PendSV exception is asynchronous and once pended will only execute when no other exceptions are pending. The main advantage is that it can be pended from an ISR.

### How FreeRTOS Does It
Very much based on the article [ARM Cortex-M RTOS Context Switching](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-rtos-context-switching#context-switching).

The [FreeRTOS `xPortPendSVHandler()` function in the `port.c`](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/GCC/ARM_CM0/port.c) code for the Cortex-M0, which I'm reading up on because it is the simplest of the Cortex-M's, is as follows (rev `83083a8a1`):

From the image of the stack above it is easier to see that the **context switch is performed between notes 5 and 6**. Hence, for steps 6 onwards, 
a **different context is being restored**... hence the context switch!

## Setup GCC (Ubuntu)

* Download the toolchain from the [ARM website](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads). The the time of writing (Dec 2022) I downloaded 11.3.Rel1 as `arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz`.
* Extract this to a directory of your choice. You could use `/usr/share`, or `/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi` for example. The following instructions were taken
  from [here](https://lindevs.com/install-arm-gnu-toolchain-on-ubuntu).
    ```
    sudo mkdir /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi
    sudo tar xf arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz --strip-components=1 -C /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/gcc-arm-none-eabi.sh
    source /etc/profile
    ```
* Add the `bin` folder under your installation directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Pre Ubuntu 23
NOTE the following steps do not work in Ubuntu 23.

* If you see the following when running GDB, install ncurses using `sudo apt install -y libncursesw5`.
    ```
    opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb: error while loading shared libraries: libncursesw.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    ```
* If after installing ncurses it moans about Python, you don't have Python (3.8) installed! On Linux, Arm GNU toolchain provides GDB with Python support. It requires installation of Python 3.8 [[Ref]](https://lindevs.com/install-arm-gnu-toolchain-on-ubuntu). To install Python 3.8 specifically:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt install -y python3.8
    ```

### Ubuntu 23 and later
Ubuntu 23 has removed the `libncurses5` and `libncursesw5` packages because they were removed in
upstream Debian [[Ref]](https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/707838).

To install the the packages you can use the _insecure_ package repository `lunar-security` by
adding the following to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file [[Ref]](https://community.localwp.com/t/i-can-not-install-localwp-into-ubuntu-23-10-because-comes-back-with-error-dependency-is-not-satisfiable-libncurses5/38920/3)[[Ref]](https://packages.ubuntu.com/lunar/amd64/libncurses5/download):

```
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lunar-security main universe
```

Then do 

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y sudo apt-get install libncurses5 libncursesw5
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

Then use Python 3.8.18 as required by the ARM GDB, it is easiest to use PyEnv, the
following taken verbatim from [[Ref]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77456816/1517244)

```
pyenv install 3.8.18
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bld-tools
sudo ln -s $PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.8.18 /usr/local/bld-tools/bld-tools-virtual-env
```

GDB should now work!


## Misc Snippets

### Am I In An ISR?
```
bool in_isr(void) {
    return (SCB->ICSR & SCB_ICSR_VECTACTIVE_Msk) != 0;
}
```


### Is Debug Probe Attached?
```
bool is_debugger_attached(void) {
    /* When a debugger attaches it should set one of these bits (note assumes a debugger that 
     * supports this is used, check your probe does this!) */
    return (DBGMCU->CR & (DBGMCU_CR_DBG_STOP | DBGMCU_CR_DBG_STANDBY)) != 0;
}
```
